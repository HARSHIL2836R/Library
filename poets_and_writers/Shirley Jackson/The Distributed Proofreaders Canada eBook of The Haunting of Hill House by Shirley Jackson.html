<div class="blockquote60percent">

<p class="noindent">Dr Montague, a scientific investigator of
ghostly phenomena, has chosen to live for
several weeks at Hill House, by repute a
place of horror that will brook no human
habitation. To check and contribute to
his observations, he selects three companions
previously unknown to him; two
girls, Theo and Eleanor, and Luke, a
young man, who is heir to Hill House.</p>

<p class="pindent">What happens cannot, in fairness, be
told. But Dr Montague’s words were prophetic:
‘A ghost cannot hurt anyone; only
the fear of ghosts can be dangerous.’
Whether the ghosts at Hill House caused
the fear, or the fear created the ghosts,
there were such manifestations as to produce,
finally, an ultimate terror that was
all too palpable and down-to-earth.</p>

<h2><a name="chap01"></a>ONE</h2>

<p class="noindent">No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under
conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are
supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by
itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood
so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within,
walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm,
and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against
the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked
there, walked alone.</p>

<p class="line">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="pindent">Dr John Montague was a doctor of philosophy; he had
taken his degree in anthropology, feeling obscurely that in
this field he might come closest to his true vocation, the
analysis of supernatural manifestations. He was scrupulous
about the use of his title because, his investigations being so
utterly unscientific, he hoped to borrow an air of respectability,
even scholarly authority, from his education. It had
cost him a good deal, in money and pride, since he was not
a begging man, to rent Hill House for three months, but
he expected absolutely to be compensated for his pains by
the sensation following upon the publication of his definitive
work on the causes and effects of psychic disturbances in
a house commonly known as ‘haunted.’ He had been looking
for an honestly haunted house all his life. When he
heard of Hill House he had been at first doubtful, then
hopeful, then indefatigable; he was not the man to let go
of Hill House once he had found it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dr Montague’s intentions with regard to Hill House
derived from the methods of the intrepid nineteenth-century
ghost hunters; he was going to go and live in Hill House
and see what happened there. It was his intention, at first,
to follow the example of the anonymous Lady who went to
stay at Ballechin House and ran a summer-long house party
for sceptics and believers, with croquet and ghost-watching
as the outstanding attractions, but sceptics, believers, and
good croquet players are harder to come by today; Dr Montague
was forced to engage assistants. Perhaps the leisurely
ways of Victorian life lent themselves more agreeably to
the devices of psychic investigation, or perhaps the painstaking
documentation of phenomena has largely gone out
as a means of determining actuality; at any rate, Dr Montague
had not only to engage assistants but to search for
them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Because he thought of himself as careful and conscientious,
he spent considerable time looking for his assistants.
He combed the records of the psychic societies, the back
files of sensational newspapers, the reports of parapsychologists,
and assembled a list of names of people who had, in
one way or another, at one time or another, no matter how
briefly or dubiously, been involved in abnormal events.
From his list he first eliminated the names of people who
were dead. When he had then crossed off the names of
those who seemed to him publicity-seekers, of subnormal
intelligence, or unsuitable because of a clear tendency to
take the centre of the stage, he had a list of perhaps a dozen
names. Each of these people, then, received a letter from
Dr Montague extending an invitation to spend all or part
of a summer at a comfortable country house, old, but perfectly
equipped with plumbing, electricity, central heating,
and clean mattresses. The purpose of their stay, the letters
stated clearly, was to observe and explore the various unsavoury
stories which had been circulated about the house
for most of its eighty years of existence. Dr Montague’s
letters did not say openly that Hill House was haunted,
because Dr Montague was a man of science and until he
had actually experienced a psychic manifestation in Hill
House he would not trust his luck too far. Consequently
his letters had a certain ambiguous dignity calculated to
catch at the imagination of a very special sort of reader. To
his dozen letters, Dr Montague had four replies, the other
eight or so candidates having presumably moved and left
no forwarding address, or possibly having lost interest in
the supernormal, or even, perhaps, never having existed at
all. To the four who replied, Dr Montague wrote again,
naming a specific day when the house would be officially
regarded as ready for occupancy, and enclosing detailed
directions for reaching it, since, as he was forced to explain,
information about finding the house was extremely difficult
to get, particularly from the rural community which surrounded
it. On the day before he was to leave for Hill
House, Dr Montague was persuaded to take into his select
company a representative of the family who owned the
house, and a telegram arrived from one of his candidates,
backing out with a clearly manufactured excuse. Another
never came or wrote, perhaps because of some pressing
personal problem which had intervened. The other two
came.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor Vance was thirty-two years old when she came
to Hill House. The only person in the world she genuinely
hated, now that her mother was dead, was her sister. She
disliked her brother-in-law and her five-year-old niece, and
she had no friends. This was owing largely to the eleven
years she had spent caring for her invalid mother, which
had left her with some proficiency as a nurse and an inability
to face strong sunlight without blinking. She could not
remember ever being truly happy in her adult life; her years
with her mother had been built up devotedly around small
guilts and small reproaches, constant weariness, and unending
despair. Without ever wanting to become reserved and
shy, she had spent so long alone, with no one to love, that
it was difficult for her to talk, even casually, to another person
without self-consciousness and an awkward inability
to find words. Her name had turned up on Dr Montague’s
list because one day, when she was twelve years old and
her sister was eighteen, and their father had been dead for
not quite a month, showers of stones had fallen on their
house, without any warning or any indication of purpose
or reason, dropping from the ceilings, rolling loudly down
the walls, breaking windows and pattering maddeningly on
the roof. The stones continued intermittently for three days,
during which time Eleanor and her sister were less unnerved
by the stones than by the neighbours and sightseers
who gathered daily outside the front door, and by
their mother’s blind, hysterical insistence that all of this
was due to malicious, backbiting people on the block who
had had it in for her ever since she came. After three days
Eleanor and her sister were removed to the house of a
friend, and the stones stopped falling, nor did they ever
return, although Eleanor and her sister and her mother
went back to living in the house, and the feud with the
entire neighbourhood was never ended. The story had been
forgotten by everyone except the people Dr Montague consulted;
it had certainly been forgotten by Eleanor and her
sister, each of whom had supposed at the time that the
other was responsible.</p>

<p class="pindent">During the whole underside of her life, ever since her
first memory, Eleanor had been waiting for something like
Hill House. Caring for her mother, lifting a cross old lady
from her chair to her bed, setting out endless little trays of
soup and oatmeal, steeling herself to the filthy laundry,
Eleanor had held fast to the belief that some day something
would happen. She had accepted the invitation to Hill
House by return mail, although her brother-in-law had
insisted upon calling a couple of people to make sure that
this doctor fellow was not aiming to introduce Eleanor to
savage rites not unconnected with matters Eleanor’s sister
deemed it improper for an unmarried young woman to
know. Perhaps, Eleanor’s sister whispered in the privacy
of the marital bedroom, perhaps Dr Montague—if that
really <span class="it">was</span> his name, after all—perhaps this Dr Montague
<span class="it">used</span> these women for some—well—<span class="it">experiments</span>. <span class="it">You</span> know—<span class="it">experiments</span>,
the way they do. Eleanor’s sister dwelt richly
upon experiments she had heard these doctors did. Eleanor
had no such ideas, or, having them, was not afraid. Eleanor,
in short, would have gone anywhere.</p>

<p class="line">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora—that was as much name as she used; her
sketches were signed ‘Theo’ and on her apartment’s door
and the window of her shop and her telephone listing and
her pale stationery and the bottom of the lovely photograph
of her which stood on the mantel, the name was always
only Theodora—Theodora was not at all like Eleanor. Duty
and conscience were, for Theodora, attributes which belonged
properly to Girl Scouts. Theodora’s world was one
of delight and soft colours; she had come on to Dr Montague’s
list because—going laughing into the laboratory,
bringing with her a rush of floral perfume—she had somehow
been able, amused and excited over her own incredible
skill, to identify correctly eighteen cards out of twenty,
fifteen cards out of twenty, nineteen cards out of twenty,
held up by an assistant out of sight and hearing. The name
of Theodora shone in the records of the laboratory and so
came inevitably to Dr Montague’s attention. Theodora had
been entertained by Dr Montague’s first letter and answered
it out of curiosity (perhaps the wakened knowledge in
Theodora which told her the names of symbols on cards
held out of sight urged her on her way towards Hill House),
and yet fully intended to decline the invitation. Yet—perhaps
the stirring, urgent sense again—when Dr Montague’s
confirming letter arrived, Theodora had been tempted and
had somehow plunged blindly, wantonly, into a violent
quarrel with the friend with whom she shared an apartment.
Things were said on both sides which only time could
eradicate; Theodora had deliberately and heartlessly
smashed the lovely little figurine her friend had carved of
her, and her friend had cruelly ripped to shreds the volume
of Alfred de Musset which had been a birthday present
from Theodora, taking particular pains with the page which
bore Theodora’s loving, teasing inscription. These acts were
of course unforgettable, and before they could laugh over
them together time would have to go by; Theodora had
written that night, accepting Dr Montague’s invitation, and
departed in cold silence the next day.</p>

<p class="line">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="pindent">Luke Sanderson was a liar. He was also a thief. His aunt,
who was the owner of Hill House, was fond of pointing
out that her nephew had the best education, the best clothes,
the best taste, and the worst companions of anyone she had
ever known; she would have leaped at any chance to put
him safely away for a few weeks. The family lawyer was
prevailed upon to persuade Dr Montague that the house
could on no account be rented to him for his purposes
without the confining presence of a member of the family
during his stay, and perhaps at their first meeting the doctor
perceived in Luke a kind of strength, or catlike instinct for
self-preservation, which made him almost as anxious as Mrs
Sanderson to have Luke with him in the house. At any
rate, Luke was amused, his aunt grateful, and Dr Montague
more than satisfied. Mrs Sanderson told the family lawyer
that at any rate there was really nothing in the house
Luke could steal. The old silver there was of some value,
she told the lawyer, but it represented an almost insuperable
difficulty for Luke: it required energy to steal
it and transform it into money. Mrs Sanderson did Luke
an injustice. Luke was not at all likely to make off with the
family silver, or Dr Montague’s watch, or Theodora’s bracelet;
his dishonesty was largely confined to taking petty
cash from his aunt’s pocketbook and cheating at cards. He
was also apt to sell the watches and cigarette cases given
him, fondly and with pretty blushes, by his aunt’s friends.
Some day Luke would inherit Hill House, but he had never
thought to find himself living in it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I just don’t think she should take the car, is all,’ Eleanor’s
brother-in-law said stubbornly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s half my car,’ Eleanor said. ‘I helped pay for it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I just don’t think she should take it, is all,’ her brother-in-law
said. He appealed to his wife. ‘It isn’t fair she should
have the use of it for the whole summer, and us have to do
without.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Carrie drives it all the time, and I never even take it out
of the garage,’ Eleanor said. ‘Besides, you’ll be in the mountains
all summer, and you can’t use it <span class="it">there</span>. Carrie, you
know you won’t use the car in the mountains.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But suppose poor little Linnie got sick or something?
And we needed a car to get her to a doctor?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s half my car,’ Eleanor said. ‘I mean to take it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Suppose even <span class="it">Carrie</span> got sick? Suppose we couldn’t get
a doctor and needed to go to a hospital?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I want it. I mean to take it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t think so.’ Carrie spoke slowly, deliberately. ‘We
don’t know where you’re going, do we? You haven’t seen
fit to tell us very much about all this, have you? I don’t think
I can see my way clear to letting you borrow my car.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s half my car.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ Carrie said. ‘You may not.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Right.’ Eleanor’s brother-in-law nodded. ‘We need it, like
Carrie says.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Carrie smiled slightly. ‘I’d never forgive myself, Eleanor,
if I lent you the car and something happened. How do we
know we can trust this doctor fellow? You’ve still a young
woman, after all, and the car is worth a good deal of money.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, now, Carrie, I <span class="it">did</span> call Homer in the credit office,
and he said this fellow was in good standing at some college
or other——’</p>

<p class="pindent">Carrie said, still smiling, ‘Of course, there is <span class="it">every</span> reason
to suppose that he is a decent man. But Eleanor does not
choose to tell us where she is going, or how to reach her
if we want the car back; something could happen, and we
might never know. Even if Eleanor,’ she went on delicately,
addressing her teacup, ‘even if <span class="it">Eleanor</span> is prepared to run
off to the ends of the earth at the invitation of any man,
there is <span class="it">still</span> no reason why she should be permitted to take
my car with her.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s half my car.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Suppose poor little Linnie got sick, up there in the mountains,
with nobody around? No doctor?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In any case, Eleanor, I am sure that I am doing what
Mother would have thought best. Mother had confidence
in me and would certainly never have approved my letting
you run wild, going off heaven knows where, in my car.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Or suppose even <span class="it">I</span> got sick, up there in——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am sure Mother would have agreed with me, Eleanor.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Besides,’ Eleanor’s brother-in-law said, struck by a sudden
idea, ‘how do we know she’d bring it back in good condition?’</p>

<p class="line">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="pindent">There has to be a first time for everything, Eleanor told
herself. She got out of the taxi, very early in the morning,
trembling because by now, perhaps, her sister and her
brother-in-law might be stirring with the first faint proddings
of suspicion; she took her suitcase quickly out of the
taxi while the driver lifted out the cardboard carton which
had been on the front seat. Eleanor overtipped him, wondering
if her sister and brother-in-law were following, were
perhaps even now turning into the street and telling each
other, ‘There she is, just as we thought, the thief, there
she is’; she turned in haste to go into the huge city garage
where their car was kept, glancing nervously towards the
ends of the street. She crashed into a very little lady, sending
packages in all directions, and saw with dismay a bag
upset and break on the sidewalk, spilling out a broken piece
of cheesecake, tomato slices, a hard roll. ‘Damn you damn
you!’ the little lady screamed, her face pushed up close
to Eleanor’s. ‘I was taking it home, damn you damn you!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m so sorry,’ Eleanor said; she bent down, but it did
not seem possible to scoop up the fragments of tomato and
cheesecake and shove them somehow back into the broken
bag. The old lady was scowling down and snatching up her
other packages before Eleanor could reach them, and at
last Eleanor rose, smiling in convulsive apology. ‘I’m really
so sorry,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Damn you,’ the little old lady said, but more quietly. ‘I
was taking it home for my little lunch. And now, thanks
to <span class="it">you</span>——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps I could pay?’ Eleanor took hold of her pocketbook,
and the little lady stood very still and thought.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I couldn’t take money, just like that,’ she said at last. ‘I
didn’t buy the things, you see. They were left over.’ She
snapped her lips angrily. ‘You should have seen the ham
they had,’ she said, ‘but someone <span class="it">else</span> got <span class="it">that</span>. And the
little candies in the little paper dishes. I was too late on
<span class="it">every</span>thing. And now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ She and Eleanor both glanced
down at the mess on the sidewalk, and the little lady said,
‘So you see, I couldn’t just take money, not money just from
your hand, not for something that was left over.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘May I buy you something to replace this, then? I’m in
a terrible hurry, but if we could find some place that’s
open——’</p>

<p class="pindent">The little old lady smiled wickedly. ‘I’ve still got <span class="it">this</span>,
anyway,’ she said, and she hugged one package tight. ‘You
may pay my taxi fare home,’ she said. ‘Then no one <span class="it">else</span>
will be likely to knock me down.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Gladly,’ Eleanor said and turned to the taxi driver, who
had been waiting, interested. ‘Can you take this lady home?’
she asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A couple of dollars will do it,’ the little lady said, ‘not
including the tip for this gentleman, of course. Being as
small as <span class="it">I</span> am,’ she explained daintily, ‘it’s quite a hazard,
quite a hazard indeed, people knocking you down. Still, it’s
a genuine pleasure to find one as willing as you to make
up for it. Sometimes the people who knock you down never
turn once to look.’ With Eleanor’s help she climbed into
the taxi with her packages, and Eleanor took two dollars
and a fifty-cent piece from her pocketbook and handed them
to the little lady, who clutched them tight in her tiny hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right, sweetheart,’ the taxi driver said, ‘where do we
go?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The little lady chuckled. ‘I’ll tell you after we start,’ she
said, and then, to Eleanor, ‘Good luck to you, dearie. Watch
out from now on how you go knocking people down.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good-bye,’ Eleanor said, ‘and I’m really very sorry.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s fine, then,’ the little lady said, waving at her as
the taxi pulled away from the kerb. ‘I’ll be praying for you,
dearie.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, Eleanor thought, staring after the taxi, there’s one
person, anyway, who will be praying for me. One person
anyway.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class="pindent">It was the first genuinely shining day of summer, a time
of year which brought Eleanor always to aching memories
of her early childhood, when it had seemed to be summer
all the time; she could not remember a winter before her
father’s death on a cold wet day. She had taken to wondering
lately, during these swift-counted years, what had been
done with all those wasted summer days; how could she
have spent them so wantonly? I am foolish, she told herself
early every summer, I am very foolish; I am grown up now
and know the values of things. Nothing is ever really wasted,
she believed sensibly, even one’s childhood, and then each
year, one summer morning, the warm wind would come
down the city street where she walked and she would be
touched with the little cold thought: I have let more time
go by. Yet this morning, driving the little car which she
and her sister owned together, apprehensive lest they might
still realise that she had come after all and just taken it
away, going docilely along the street, following the lines
of traffic, stopping when she was bidden and turning when
she could, she smiled out at the sunlight slanting along the
street and thought, I am going, I am going, I have finally
taken a step.</p>

<p class="pindent">Always before, when she had her sister’s permission to
drive the little car, she had gone cautiously, moving with
extreme care to avoid even the slightest scratch or mar
which might irritate her sister, but today, with her carton
on the back seat and her suitcase on the floor, her gloves
and pocketbook and light coat on the seat beside her, the
car belonged entirely to her, a little self-contained world all
her own; I am really going, she thought.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the last traffic light in the city, before she turned to
go on to the great highway out of town, she stopped,
waiting, and slid Dr Montague’s letter out of her pocketbook.
I will not even need a map, she thought; he must be
a very careful man. ‘.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Route 39 to Ashton,’ the letter said,
‘and then turn left on to Route 5 going west. Follow this
for a little less than thirty miles, and you will come to the
small village of Hillsdale. Go through Hillsdale to the corner
with a gas station on the left and a church on the right,
and turn left here on to what seems to be a narrow country
road; you will be going up into the hills and the road is
very poor. Follow this road to the end—about six miles—and
you will come to the gates of Hill House. I am making
these directions so detailed because it is inadvisable to
stop in Hillsdale to ask your way. The people there are rude
to strangers and openly hostile to anyone inquiring about
Hill House.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am very happy that you will be joining us in Hill House,
and will take great pleasure in making your acquaintance
on Thursday the twenty-first of June.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The light changed; she turned on to the highway and
was free of the city. No one, she thought, can catch me
now; they don’t even know which way I’m going.</p>

<p class="pindent">She had never driven far alone before. The notion of
dividing her lovely journey into miles and hours was silly;
she saw it, bringing her car with precision between the line
on the road and the line of trees beside the road, as a
passage of moments, each one new, carrying her along with
them, taking her down a path of incredible novelty to a
new place. The journey itself was her positive action, her
destination vague, unimagined, perhaps non-existent. She
meant to savour each turn of her travelling, loving the road
and the trees and the houses and the small ugly towns,
teasing herself with the notion that she might take it into
her head to stop just anywhere and never leave again. She
might pull her car to the side of the highway—although
that was not allowed, she told herself; she would be
punished if she really did—and leave it behind while she
wandered off past the trees into the soft, welcoming country
beyond. She might wander till she was exhausted, chasing
butterflies or following a stream, and then come at nightfall
to the hut of some poor woodcutter who would offer her
shelter; she might make her home for ever in East Barrington
or Desmond or the incorporated village of Berk; she
might never leave the road at all, but just hurry on and on
until the wheels of the car were worn to nothing and she
had come to the end of the world.</p>

<p class="pindent">And, she thought, I might just go along to Hill House,
where I am expected and where I am being given shelter
and room and board and a small token salary in consideration
of forsaking my commitments and involvements in the
city and running away to see the world. I wonder what
Dr Montague is like. I wonder what Hill House is like. I
wonder who else will be there.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was well away from the city now, watching for the
turning on to Route 39, that magic thread of road Dr Montague
had chosen for her, out of all the roads in the world,
to bring her safely to him and to Hill House; no other road
could lead her from where she was to where she wanted
to be. Dr Montague was confirmed, made infallible; under
the sign which pointed the way to Route 39 was another
sign saying: <span style="font-size:smaller">ASHTON</span>, 121 <span style="font-size:smaller">MILES</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">The road, her intimate friend now, turned and dipped,
going around turns where surprises waited—once a cow,
regarding her over a fence, once an incurious dog—down
into hollows where small towns lay, past fields and orchards.
On the main street of one village she passed a vast house,
pillared and walled, with shutters over the windows and a
pair of stone lions guarding the steps, and she thought that
perhaps she might live there, dusting the lions each morning
and patting their heads good night. Time is beginning this
morning in June, she assured herself, but it is a time that is
strangely new and of itself; in these few seconds I have lived
a lifetime in a house with two lions in front. Every morning
I swept the porch and dusted the lions, and every evening
I patted their heads good night, and once a week I washed
their faces and manes and paws with warm water and soda
and cleaned between their teeth with a swab. Inside the
house the rooms were tall and clear with shining floors and
polished windows. A little dainty old lady took care of me,
moving starchily with a silver tea service on a tray and
bringing me a glass of elderberry wine each evening for
my health’s sake. I took my dinner alone in the long, quiet
dining-room at the gleaming table, and between the tall
windows the white panelling of the walls shone in the
candlelight; I dined upon a bird, and radishes from the
garden, and home-made plum jam. When I slept it was
under a canopy of white organdie, and a nightlight guarded
me from the hall. People bowed to me on the streets of
the town because everyone was very proud of my lions.
When I died .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">She had left the town far behind by now, and was going
past dirty, closed lunch stands and torn signs. There had
been a fair somewhere near here once, long ago, with motorcycle
races; the signs still carried fragments of words. <span style="font-size:smaller">Dare</span>,
one of them read, and another, <span style="font-size:smaller">EVIL</span>, and she laughed at
herself, perceiving how she sought out omens everywhere;
the word is <span style="font-size:smaller">DAREDEVIL</span>, Eleanor, daredevil drivers, and she
slowed her car because she was driving too fast and might
reach Hill House too soon.</p>

<p class="pindent">At one spot she stopped altogether beside the road to
stare in disbelief and wonder. Along the road for perhaps
a quarter of a mile she had been passing and admiring a
row of splendid tended oleanders, blooming pink and white
in a steady row. Now she had come to the gateway they
protected, and past the gateway the trees continued. The
gateway was no more than a pair of ruined stone pillars,
with a road leading away between them into empty fields.
She could see that the oleander trees cut away from the
road and ran up each side of a great square, and she could
see all the way to the farther side of the square, which was
a line of oleander trees seemingly going along a little river.
Inside the oleander square there was nothing, no house, no
building, nothing but the straight road going across and
ending at the stream. Now what was here, she wondered,
what was here and is gone, or what was going to be here
and never came? Was it going to be a house or a garden
or an orchard; were they driven away for ever or are they
coming back? Oleanders are poisonous, she remembered;
could they be here guarding something? Will I, she thought,
will I get out of my car and go between the ruined gates
and then, once I am in the magic oleander square, find that
I have wandered into a fairyland, protected poisonously
from the eyes of people passing? Once I have stepped
between the magic gateposts, will I find myself through the
protective barrier, the spell broken? I will go into a sweet
garden, with fountains and low benches and roses trained
over arbours, and find one path—jewelled, perhaps, with
rubies and emeralds, soft enough for a king’s daughter to
walk upon with her little sandalled feet—and it will lead
me directly to the palace which lies under a spell. I will
walk up low stone steps past stone lions guarding and into
a courtyard where a fountain plays and the queen waits,
weeping, for the princess to return. She will drop her embroidery
when she sees me, and cry out to the palace
servants—stirring at last after their long sleep—to prepare
a great feast, because the enchantment is ended and the
palace is itself again. And we shall live happily ever after.</p>

<p class="pindent">No, of course, she thought, turning to start her car again,
once the palace becomes visible and the spell is broken, the
<span class="it">whole</span> spell will be broken and all this countryside outside
the oleanders will return to its proper form, fading away,
towns and signs and cows, into a soft green picture from
a fairy tale. Then, coming down from the hills there will
be a prince riding, bright in green and silver with a hundred
bowmen riding behind him, pennants stirring, horses tossing,
jewels flashing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed and turned to smile good-bye at the magic
oleanders. Another day, she told them, another day I’ll
come back and break your spell.</p>

<p class="pindent">She stopped for lunch after she had driven a hundred
miles and a mile. She found a country restaurant which
advertised itself as an old mill and found herself seated,
incredibly, upon a balcony over a dashing stream, looking
down upon wet rocks and the intoxicating sparkle of moving
water, with a cut-glass bowl of cottage cheese on the table
before her, and corn sticks in a napkin. Because this was
a time and a land where enchantments were swiftly made
and broken she wanted to linger over her lunch, knowing
that Hill House always waited for her at the end of her
day. The only other people in the dining-room were a
family party, a mother and father with a small boy and girl,
and they talked to one another softly and gently, and once
the little girl turned and regarded Eleanor with frank
curiosity and, after a minute, smiled. The lights from the
stream below touched the ceiling and the polished tables
and glanced along the little girl’s curls, and the little girl’s
mother said, ‘She wants her cup of stars.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor looked up, surprised; the little girl was sliding
back in her chair, sullenly refusing her milk, while her father
frowned and her brother giggled and her mother said
calmly, ‘She wants her cup of stars.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Indeed yes, Eleanor thought; indeed, so do I; a cup of
stars, of course.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Her little cup,’ the mother was explaining, smiling apologetically
at the waitress, who was thunderstruck at the
thought that the mill’s good country milk was not rich
enough for the little girl. ‘It has stars in the bottom, and
she always drinks her milk from it at home. She calls it her
cup of stars because she can see the stars while she drinks
her milk.’ The waitress nodded, unconvinced, and the
mother told the little girl, ‘You’ll have your milk from your
cup of stars tonight when we get home. But just for now,
just to be a very good little girl, will you take a little milk
from this glass?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Don’t do it, Eleanor told the little girl; insist on your cup
of stars; once they have trapped you into being like everyone
else you will never see your cup of stars again; don’t
do it; and the little girl glanced at her, and smiled a little
subtle, dimpling, wholly comprehending smile, and shook
her head stubbornly at the glass. Brave girl, Eleanor
thought; wise, brave girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re spoiling her,’ the father said. ‘She ought not to
be allowed these whims.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just this once,’ the mother said. She put down the glass
of milk and touched the little girl gently on the hand. ‘Eat
your ice cream,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">When they left, the little girl waved good-bye to Eleanor,
and Eleanor waved back, sitting in joyful loneliness to finish
her coffee while the gay stream tumbled along below her.
I have not very much farther to go, Eleanor thought; I am
more than half-way there. Journey’s end, she thought, and
far back in her mind, sparkling like the little stream, a
tag end of a tune danced through her head, bringing distantly
a word or so; ‘In delay there lies no plenty,’ she
thought, ‘in delay there lies no plenty.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She nearly stopped for ever just outside Ashton, because
she came to a tiny cottage buried in a garden. I could
live there all alone, she thought, slowing the car to look
down the winding garden path to the small blue front door
with, perfectly, a white cat on the step. No one would ever
find me there, either, behind all those roses, and just to
make sure I would plant oleanders by the road. I will light
a fire in the cool evenings and toast apples at my own hearth.
I will raise white cats and sew white curtains for the windows
and sometimes come out of my door to go to the store
to buy cinnamon and tea and thread. People will come to
me to have their fortunes told, and I will brew love potions
for sad maidens; I will have a robin.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But the cottage
was far behind, and it was time to look for her new road,
so carefully charted by Dr Montague.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Turn left on to Route 5 going west,’ his letter said, and,
as efficiently and promptly as though he had been guiding
her from some spot far away, moving her car with controls
in his hands, it was done; she was on Route 5 going
west, and her journey was nearly done. In spite of what he
said, though, she thought, I will stop in Hillsdale for a
minute, just for a cup of coffee, because I cannot bear to
have my long trip end so soon. It was not really disobeying,
anyway; the letter said it was inadvisable to stop in Hillsdale
to ask the way, not forbidden to stop for coffee,
and perhaps if I don’t mention Hill House I will not be
doing wrong. Anyway, she thought obscurely, it’s my last
chance.</p>

<p class="pindent">Hillsdale was upon her before she knew it, a tangled
disorderly mess of dirty houses and crooked streets. It was
small; once she had come on to the main street she could
see the corner at the end with the gas station and the
church. There seemed to be only one place to stop for
coffee, and that was an unattractive diner, but Eleanor was
bound to stop in Hillsdale and so she brought her car to
the broken kerb in front of the diner and got out. After a
minute’s thought, with a silent nod to Hillsdale, she locked
the car, mindful of her suitcase on the floor and the carton
on the back seat. I will not spend long in Hillsdale, she
thought, looking up and down the street, which managed,
even in the sunlight, to be dark and ugly. A dog slept uneasily
in the shade against a wall, a woman stood in a doorway
across the street and looked at Eleanor, and two young
boys lounged against a fence, elaborately silent. Eleanor,
who was afraid of strange dogs and jeering women and
young hoodlums, went quickly into the diner, clutching her
pocketbook and her car keys. Inside, she found a counter
with a chinless, tired girl behind it, and a man sitting at
the end eating. She wondered briefly how hungry he must
have been to come in here at all, when she looked at the
grey counter and the smeared glass bowl over a plate of
doughnuts. ‘Coffee,’ she said to the girl behind the counter,
and the girl turned wearily and tumbled down a cup from
the piles on the shelves; I will have to drink this coffee
because I said I was going to, Eleanor told herself sternly,
but next time I will listen to Dr Montague.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was some elaborate joke going on between the
man eating and the girl behind the counter; when she set
Eleanor’s coffee down she glanced at him and half-smiled,
and he shrugged, and then the girl laughed. Eleanor looked
up, but the girl was examining her fingernails and the man
was wiping his plate with bread. Perhaps Eleanor’s coffee
was poisoned; it certainly looked it. Determined to plumb
the village of Hillsdale to its lowest depths, Eleanor said
to the girl, ‘I’ll have one of those doughnuts too, please,’
and the girl, glancing sideways at the man, slid one of the
doughnuts on to a dish and set it down in front of Eleanor
and laughed when she caught another look from the man.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This is a pretty little town,’ Eleanor said to the girl. ‘What
is it called?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl stared at her; perhaps no one had ever before
had the audacity to call Hillsdale a pretty little town; after
a moment the girl looked again at the man, as though calling
for confirmation, and said, ‘Hillsdale.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Have you lived here long?’ Eleanor asked. I’m not going
to mention Hill House, she assured Dr Montague far away,
I just want to waste a little time.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yeah,’ the girl said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It must be pleasant, living in a small town like this. I
come from the city.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yeah?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Do you like it here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s all right,’ the girl said. She looked again at the man,
who was listening carefully. ‘Not much to do.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How large a town is it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Pretty small. You want more coffee?’ This was addressed
to the man, who was rattling his cup against his saucer, and
Eleanor took a first, shuddering sip of her own coffee and
wondered how he could possibly want more.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Do you have a lot of visitors around here?’ she asked
when the girl had filled the coffee cup and gone back to
lounge against the shelves. ‘Tourists, I mean?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What for?’ For a minute the girl flashed at her, from
what might have been an emptiness greater than any
Eleanor had ever known. ‘Why would anybody come <span class="it">here</span>?’
She looked sullenly at the man and added, ‘There’s not even
a movie.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But the hills are so pretty. Mostly, with small out-of-the-way
towns like this one, you’ll find city people who have
come and built themselves homes up in the hills. For
privacy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl laughed shortly. ‘Not <span class="it">here</span> they don’t.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Or remodelling old houses——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Privacy,’ the girl said, and laughed again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It just seems surprising,’ Eleanor said, feeling the man
looking at her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yeah,’ the girl said. ‘If they’d put in a movie, even.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I thought,’ Eleanor said carefully, ‘that I might even look
around. Old houses are usually cheap, you know, and it’s
fun to make them over.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not around here,’ the girl said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then,’ Eleanor said, ‘there are no old houses around here?
Back in the hills?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nope.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man rose, taking change from his pocket, and spoke
for the first time. ‘People <span class="it">leave</span> this town,’ he said. ‘They
don’t <span class="it">come</span> here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">When the door closed behind him the girl turned her
flat eyes back to Eleanor, almost resentfully, as though
Eleanor with her chatter had driven the man away. ‘He
was right,’ she said finally. ‘They go away, the lucky ones.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why don’t <span class="it">you</span> run away?’ Eleanor asked her, and the
girl shrugged.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Would I be any better off?’ she asked. She took Eleanor’s
money without interest and returned the change. Then, with
another of her quick flashes, she glanced at the empty plates
at the end of the counter and almost smiled. ‘He comes in
every day,’ she said. When Eleanor smiled back and started
to speak, the girl turned her back and busied herself with
the cups on the shelves, and Eleanor, feeling herself dismissed,
rose gratefully from her coffee and took up her car
keys and pocketbook. ‘Good-bye,’ Eleanor said, and the girl,
back still turned, said, ‘Good luck to you. I hope you find
your house.’</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class="pindent">The road leading away from the gas station and the
church was very poor indeed, deeply rutted and rocky.
Eleanor’s little car stumbled and bounced, reluctant to go
farther into these unattractive hills, where the day seemed
quickly drawing to an end under the thick, oppressive trees
on either side. They do not really seem to have much traffic
on this road, Eleanor thought wryly, turning the wheel
quickly to avoid a particularly vicious rock ahead; six miles
of this will not do the car any good; and for the first time
in hours she thought of her sister and laughed. By now they
would surely know that she had taken the car and gone, but
they would not know where; they would be telling each
other incredulously that they would never have suspected
it of Eleanor. I would never have suspected it of myself, she
thought, laughing still; everything is different, I am a new
person, very far from home. ‘In delay there lies no plenty;
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. present mirth hath present laughter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ And she gasped
as the car cracked against a rock and reeled back across
the road with an ominous scraping somewhere beneath, but
then gathered itself together valiantly and resumed its
dogged climb. The tree branches brushed against the windshield,
and it grew steadily darker; Hill House likes to make
an entrance, she thought; I wonder if the sun ever shines
along here. At last, with one final effort, the car cleared a
tangle of dead leaves and small branches across the road,
and came into a clearing by the gate of Hill House.</p>

<p class="pindent">Why am I here? she thought helplessly and at once; why
am I here? The gate was tall and ominous and heavy, set
strongly into a stone wall which went off through the trees.
Even from the car she could see the padlock and the chain
that was twisted around and through the bars. Beyond the
gate she could see only that the road continued, turned,
shadowed on either side by the still, dark trees.</p>

<p class="pindent">Since the gate was so clearly locked—locked and double-locked
and chained and barred; who, she wondered, wants
so badly to get in?—she made no attempt to get out of her
car, but pressed the horn, and the trees and the gate shuddered
and withdrew slightly from the sound. After a minute
she blew the horn again and then saw a man coming towards
her from inside the gate; he was as dark and unwelcoming
as the padlock, and before he moved towards the gate he
peered through the bars at her, scowling.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What <span class="it">you</span> want?’ His voice was sharp, mean.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I want to come in, please. Please unlock the gate.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Who say?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why——’ She faltered. ‘I’m supposed to come in,’ she
said at last.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What for?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am expected.’ Or am I? she wondered suddenly; is this
as far as I go?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Who by?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She knew, of course, that he was delighting in exceeding
his authority, as though once he moved to unlock the gate
he would lose the little temporary superiority he thought
he had—and what superiority have I? she wondered; I am
<span class="it">outside</span> the gate, after all. She could already see that losing
her temper, which she did rarely because she was so afraid
of being ineffectual, would only turn him away, leaving her
still outside the gate, railing futilely. She could even anticipate
his innocence if he were reproved later for this arrogance—the
maliciously vacant grin, the wide, blank eyes,
the whining voice protesting that he <span class="it">would</span> have let her in,
he <span class="it">planned</span> to let her in, but how could he be sure? He had
his orders, didn’t he? And he had to do what he was told?
<span class="it">He</span>’d be the one to get into trouble, wouldn’t he, if he let in
someone wasn’t supposed to be inside? She could anticipate
his shrug, and, picturing him, laughed, perhaps the worst
thing she could have done.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eyeing her, he moved back from the gate. ‘You better
come back later,’ he said, and turned his back with an air
of virtuous triumph.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Listen,’ she called after him, still trying not to sound
angry, ‘I am one of Doctor Montague’s guests; he will be
expecting me in the house—please <span class="it">listen</span> to me!’</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned and grinned at her. ‘They couldn’t rightly be
<span class="it">expecting</span> you,’ he said, ‘seeing as you’re the only one’s
<span class="it">come</span>, so far.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Do you mean that there’s no one in the house?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No one <span class="it">I</span> know of. Maybe my wife, getting it fixed up.
So they couldn’t be there exactly <span class="it">expecting</span> you, now <span class="it">could</span>
they?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She sat back against the car seat and closed her eyes. Hill
House, she thought, you’re as hard to get into as heaven.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I suppose you know what you’re <span class="it">asking</span> for, coming
here? I suppose they told you, back in the city? You <span class="it">hear</span>
anything about this place?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I heard that I was invited here as a guest of Doctor
Montague’s. When you open the gates I will go inside.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll open them; I’m going to open them. I just want to
be sure you know what’s waiting for you in there. You
ever been here before? One of the family, maybe?’ He
looked at her now, peering through the bars, his jeering
face one more barrier, after padlock and chain. ‘I can’t let
you in till I’m <span class="it">sure</span>, can I? What’d you say your name was?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She sighed. ‘Eleanor Vance.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not one of the family then, I guess. You ever hear anything
about this place?’</p>

<p class="pindent">It’s my chance, I suppose, she thought; I’m being given a
last chance. I could turn my car around right here and
now in front of these gates and go away from here, and no
one would blame me. Anyone has a right to run away. She
put her head out through the car window and said with
fury, ‘My name is Eleanor Vance. I am expected in Hill
House. Unlock those gates at once.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right, all <span class="it">right</span>.’ Deliberately, making a wholly unnecessary
display of fitting the key and turning it, he opened
the padlock and loosened the chain and swung the gates
just wide enough for the car to come through. Eleanor
moved the car slowly, but the alacrity with which he leaped
to the side of the road made her think for a minute that
he had perceived the fleeting impulse crossing her mind;
she laughed, and then stopped the car because he was
coming towards her—safely, from the side.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You won’t like it,’ he said. ‘You’ll be sorry I ever opened
that gate.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Out of the way, please,’ she said. ‘You’ve held me up
long enough.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You think they could get anyone else to open this gate?
You think anyone else’d stay around here that long, except
me and my wife? You think we can’t have things just about
the way we want them, long as we stay around here and fix
up the house and open the gates for all you city people
think you know everything?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Please get away from my car.’ She dared not admit to
herself that he frightened her, for fear that he might perceive
it; his nearness, leaning against the side of the car,
was ugly, and his enormous resentment puzzled her; she had
certainly made him open the gate for her, but did he think
of the house and gardens inside as his own? A name from
Dr Montague’s letter came into her mind, and she asked
curiously, ‘Are you Dudley, the caretaker?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, I’m Dudley, the caretaker.’ He mimicked her. ‘Who
else you think would be around here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The honest old family retainer, she thought, proud and
loyal and thoroughly unpleasant. ‘You and your wife take
care of the house all alone?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Who else?’ It was his boast, his curse, his refrain.</p>

<p class="pindent">She moved restlessly, afraid to draw away from him too
obviously, and yet wanting, with small motions of starting
the car, to make him stand aside. ‘I’m sure you’ll be able to
make us very comfortable, you and your wife,’ she said,
putting a tone of finality into her voice. ‘Meanwhile, I’m
very anxious to get to the house as soon as possible.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He snickered disagreeably. ‘<span class="it">Me</span>, now,’ he said, ‘me, I don’t
hang around here after dark.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Grinning, satisfied with himself, he stood away from the
car, and Eleanor was grateful, although awkward starting
the car under his eye; perhaps he will keep popping out at
me all along the drive, she thought, a sneering Cheshire
Cat, yelling each time that I should be happy to find anyone
willing to hang around this place, until dark, anyway.
To show that she was not at all affected by the thought of
the face of Dudley the caretaker between the trees she
began to whistle, a little annoyed to find that the same tune
still ran through her head. ‘Present mirth hath present
laughter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ And she told herself crossly that she must
really make an effort to think of something else; she was
sure that the rest of the words must be most unsuitable, to
hide so stubbornly from her memory, and probably wholly
disreputable to be caught singing on her arrival at Hill
House.</p>

<p class="pindent">Over the trees, occasionally, between them and the hills,
she caught glimpses of what must be the roofs, perhaps a
tower, of Hill House. They made houses so oddly back
when Hill House was built, she thought; they put towers
and turrets and buttresses and wooden lace on them, even
sometimes Gothic spires and gargoyles; nothing was ever
left undecorated. Perhaps Hill House has a tower, or a
secret chamber, or even a passageway going off into the
hills and probably used by smugglers—although what could
smugglers find to smuggle around these lonely hills? Perhaps
I will encounter a devilishly handsome smuggler and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned her car on to the last stretch of straight drive
leading her directly, face to face, to Hill House and, moving
without thought, pressed her foot on the brake to stall the
car and sat, staring.</p>

<p class="pindent">The house was vile. She shivered and thought, the words
coming freely into her mind, Hill House is vile, it is diseased;
get away from here at once.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02"></a>TWO</h2>

<p class="noindent">No human eye can isolate the unhappy coincidence of line
and place which suggests evil in the face of a house, and
yet somehow a maniac juxtaposition, a badly turned angle,
some chance meeting of roof and sky, turned Hill House
into a place of despair, more frightening because the face
of Hill House seemed awake, with a watchfulness from the
blank windows and a touch of glee in the eyebrow of a
cornice. Almost any house, caught unexpectedly or at an
odd angle, can turn a deeply humorous look on a watching
person; even a mischievous little chimney, or a dormer like
a dimple, can catch up a beholder with a sense of fellowship;
but a house arrogant and hating, never off guard, can
only be evil. This house, which seemed somehow to have
formed itself, flying together into its own powerful pattern
under the hands of its builders, fitting itself into its own
construction of lines and angles, reared its great head back
against the sky without concession to humanity. It was a
house without kindness, never meant to be lived in, not a
fit place for people or for love or for hope. Exorcism cannot
alter the countenance of a house; Hill House would stay
as it was until it was destroyed.</p>

<p class="pindent">I should have turned back at the gate, Eleanor thought.
The house had caught her with an atavistic turn in the pit
of the stomach, and she looked along the lines of its roofs,
fruitlessly endeavouring to locate the badness, whatever
dwelt there; her hands turned nervously cold so that she
fumbled, trying to take out a cigarette, and beyond everything
else she was afraid, listening to the sick voice inside
her which whispered, <span class="it">Get away from here, get away</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">But this is what I came so far to find, she told herself; I
can’t go back. Besides, he would laugh at me if I tried to
get back out through that gate.</p>

<p class="pindent">Trying not to look up at the house—and she could not
even have told its colour, or its style, or its size, except that
it was enormous and dark, looking down over her—she
started the car again, and drove up the last bit of driveway
directly to the steps, which led in a forthright, no-escape
manner on to the verandah and aimed at the front door. The
drive turned off on either side, to encircle the house, and
probably later she could take her car around and find a
building of some kind to put it in; now she felt uneasily
that she did not care to cut off her means of departure too
completely. She turned the car just enough to move it off
to one side, out of the way of later arrivals—it would be
a pity, she thought grimly, for anyone to get a first look
at this house with anything so comforting as a human automobile
parked in front of it—and got out, taking her suitcase
and her coat. Well, she thought inadequately, here I
am.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was an act of moral strength to lift her foot and set it
on the bottom step, and she thought that her deep unwillingness
to touch Hill House for the first time came directly
from the vivid feeling that it was waiting for her, evil, but
patient. Journeys end in lovers meeting, she thought, remembering
her song at last, and laughed, standing on the
steps of Hill House, journeys end in lovers meeting, and
she put her feet down firmly and went up to the verandah
and the door. Hill House came around her in a rush; she
was enshadowed, and the sound of her feet on the wood
of the verandah was an outrage in the utter silence, as
though it had been a very long time since feet stamped
across the boards of Hill House. She brought her hand up
to the heavy iron knocker that had a child’s face, determined
to make more noise and yet more, so that Hill House might
be very sure she was there, and then the door opened without
warning and she was looking at a woman who, if like
ever merited like, could only be the wife of the man at the
gate.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mrs Dudley?’ she said, catching her breath. ‘I’m Eleanor
Vance. I’m expected.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Silently the woman stood aside. Her apron was clean, her
hair was neat, and yet she gave an indefinable air of dirtiness,
quite in keeping with her husband, and the suspicious
sullenness of her face was a match for the malicious petulance
of his. No, Eleanor told herself; it’s partly because
everything seems so dark around here, and partly because
I expected that man’s wife to be ugly. If I hadn’t seen Hill
House, would I be so unfair to these people? They only
take care of it, after all.</p>

<p class="pindent">The hall in which they stood was overfull of dark wood
and weighty carving, dim under the heaviness of the staircase,
which lay back from the farther end. Above there
seemed to be another hallway, going the width of the house;
she could see a wide landing and then, across the staircase
well, doors closed along the upper hall. On either side of
her now were great double doors, carved with fruit and
grain and living things; all the doors she could see in this
house were closed.</p>

<p class="pindent">When she tried to speak, her voice was drowned in the
dim stillness, and she had to try again to make a sound.
‘Can you take me to my room?’ she asked at last, gesturing
towards her suitcase on the floor and watching the wavering
reflection of her hand going down and down into the deep
shadows of the polished floor, ‘I gather I’m the first one
here. You—you <span class="it">did</span> say you were Mrs Dudley?’ I think I’m
going to cry, she thought, like a child sobbing and wailing,
<span class="it">I don’t like it here</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Dudley turned and started up the stairs, and Eleanor
took up her suitcase and followed, hurrying after anything
else alive in this house. No, she thought, I don’t like it here.
Mrs Dudley came to the top of the stairs and turned right,
and Eleanor saw that with some rare perception the builders
of the house had given up any attempt at style—probably
after realising what the house was going to be, whether
they chose it or not—and had, on this second floor, set in
a long, straight hall to accommodate the doors to the bedrooms;
she had a quick impression of the builders finishing
off the second and third storeys of the house with a kind
of indecent haste, eager to finish their work without embellishment
and get out of there, following the simplest
possible pattern for the rooms. At the left end of the hall
was a second staircase, probably going from servants’ rooms
on the third floor down past the second to the service rooms
below; at the right end of the hall another room had been
set in, perhaps, since it was on the end, to get the maximum
amount of sun and light. Except for a continuation
of the dark woodwork, and what looked like a series of
poorly executed engravings arranged with unlovely exactness
along the hall in either direction, nothing broke the
straightness of the hall except the series of doors, all closed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Dudley crossed the hall and opened a door, perhaps
at random. ‘This is the blue room,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">From the turn in the staircase Eleanor assumed that the
room would be at the front of the house; sister Anne, sister
Anne, she thought, and moved gratefully towards the light
from the room. ‘How nice,’ she said, standing in the doorway,
but only from the sense that she must say something;
it was not nice at all, and only barely tolerable; it held enclosed
the same clashing disharmony that marked Hill
House throughout.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Dudley turned aside to let Eleanor come in, and
spoke, apparently to the wall. ‘I set dinner on the dining-room
sideboard at six sharp,’ she said. ‘You can serve yourselves.
I clear up in the morning. I have breakfast ready
for you at nine. That’s the way I agreed to do. I can’t keep
the rooms up the way you’d like; but there’s no one else
you could get that would help me. I don’t wait on people.
What I agreed to, it doesn’t mean I wait on people.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor nodded, standing uncertainly in the doorway.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t stay after I set out dinner,’ Mrs Dudley went
on. ‘Not after it begins to get dark. I leave before dark
comes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I know,’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We live over in the town, six miles away.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ Eleanor said, remembering Hillsdale.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So there won’t be anyone around if you need help.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I understand.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We couldn’t even hear you, in the night.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t suppose——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No one could. No one lives any nearer than the town.
No one else will come any nearer than that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I know,’ Eleanor said tiredly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In the night,’ Mrs Dudley said, and smiled outright. ‘In
the dark,’ she said, and closed the door behind her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor almost giggled, thinking of herself calling, ‘Oh,
Mrs Dudley, I need your help in the dark,’ and then she
shivered.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="pindent">She stood alone beside her suitcase, her coat still hanging
over her arm, thoroughly miserable, telling herself helplessly,
Journeys end in lovers meeting, and wishing she
could go home. Behind her lay the dark staircase and the
polished hallway and the great front door and Mrs Dudley
and Dudley laughing at the gate and the padlocks and Hillsdale
and the cottage of flowers and the family at the inn
and the oleander garden and the house with the stone lions
in front, and they had brought her, under Dr Montague’s
unerring eye, to the blue room at Hill House. It’s awful,
she thought, unwilling to move, since motion might imply
acceptance, a gesture of moving in, it’s awful and I don’t
want to stay; but there was nowhere else to go; Dr
Montague’s letter had brought her this far and could
take her no farther. After a minute she sighed and shook
her head and walked across to set her suitcase down on
the bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Here I am in the blue room of Hill House, she said half
aloud, although it was real enough, and beyond all question
a blue room. There were blue dimity curtains over the two
windows, which looked out over the roof of the verandah
on to the lawn, and a blue-figured rug on the floor, and a
blue spread on the bed and a blue quilt at the foot. The
walls, dark woodwork to shoulder height, were blue-figured
paper above, with a design of tiny blue flowers, wreathed
and gathered and delicate. Perhaps someone had once hoped
to lighten the air of the blue room in Hill House with a
dainty wallpaper, not seeing how such a hope would
evaporate in Hill House, leaving only the faintest hint of
its existence, like an almost inaudible echo of sobbing far
away.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Eleanor shook herself, turning to see the room
complete. It had an unbelievably faulty design which left
it chillingly wrong in all its dimensions, so that the walls
seemed always in one direction a fraction longer than the
eye could endure, and in another direction a fraction less
than the barest possible tolerable length; this is where they
want me to <span class="it">sleep</span>, Eleanor thought incredulously; what
nightmares are waiting, shadowed, in those high corners—what
breath of mindless fear will drift across my mouth
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and shook herself again. <span class="it">Really</span>, she told herself, <span class="it">really</span>,
Eleanor.</p>

<p class="pindent">She opened her suitcase on the high bed and, slipping off
her stiff city shoes with grateful relief, began to unpack,
at the back of her mind the thoroughly female conviction
that the best way to soothe a troubled mind is to put on
comfortable shoes. Yesterday, packing her suitcase in the
city, she had chosen clothes which she assumed would be
suitable for wearing in an isolated country house; she had
even run out at the last minute and bought—excited at her
own daring—two pairs of slacks, something she had not
worn in more years than she could remember. Mother
would be <span class="it">furious</span>, she had thought, packing the slacks down
at the bottom of her suitcase so that she need not take them
out, need never let anyone know she had them, in case she
lost her courage. Now, in Hill House, they no longer seemed
so new; she unpacked carelessly, setting dresses crookedly
on hangers, tossing the slacks into the bottom drawer of the
high marble-topped dresser, throwing her city shoes into
a corner of the great wardrobe. She was bored already with
the books she had brought; I am probably not going to stay
anyway, she thought, and closed her empty suitcase and set
it in the wardrobe corner; it won’t take me five minutes to
pack again. She discovered that she had been trying to put
her suitcase down without making a sound and then realised
that while she unpacked she had been in her stockinged
feet, trying to move as silently as possible, as though stillness
were vital in Hill House; she remembered that Mrs Dudley
had also walked without sound. When she stood still in the
middle of the room the pressing silence of Hill House came
back all around her. I am like a small creature swallowed
whole by a monster, she thought, and the monster feels my
tiny little movements inside. ‘No,’ she said aloud, and the
one word echoed. She went quickly across the room and
pushed aside the blue dimity curtains, but the sunlight came
only palely through the thick glass of the windows, and she
could see only the roof of the verandah and a stretch of
the lawn beyond. Somewhere down there was her little car,
which could take her away again. Journeys end in lovers
meeting, she thought; it was my own choice to come. Then
she realised that she was afraid to go back across the
room.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was standing with her back to the window, looking
from the door to the wardrobe to the dresser to the bed,
telling herself that she was not afraid at all, when she heard,
far below, the sounds of a car door slamming and then
quick footsteps, almost dancing, up the steps and across the
verandah, and then, shockingly, the crash of the great iron
knocker coming down. Why, she thought, there are other
people coming; I am not going to be here all alone. Almost
laughing, she ran across the room and into the hall, to look
down the staircase into the hallway below.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank heaven you’re here,’ she said, peering through
the dimness, ‘thank heaven somebody’s here.’ She realised
without surprise that she was speaking as though Mrs
Dudley could not hear her, although Mrs Dudley stood,
straight and pale, in the hall. ‘Come on up,’ Eleanor said,
‘you’ll have to carry your own suitcase.’ She was breathless
and seemed unable to stop talking, her usual shyness melted
away by relief. ‘My name’s Eleanor Vance,’ she said, ‘and
‘I’m so glad you’re here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m Theodora. Just Theodora. This <span class="it">bloody</span> house——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s just as bad up here. Come on up. Make her give you
the room next to mine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora came up the heavy stairway after Mrs Dudley,
looking incredulously at the stained-glass window on the
landing, the marble urn in a niche, the patterned carpet.
Her suitcase was considerably larger than Eleanor’s, and
considerably more luxurious, and Eleanor came forward
to help her, glad that her own things were safely put away
out of sight. ‘Wait till you see the bedrooms,’ Eleanor said.
‘Mine used to be the embalming room, I think.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s the home I’ve always dreamed of,’ Theodora said.
‘A little hideaway where I can be alone with my thoughts.
Particularly if my thoughts happened to be about murder
or suicide or——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Green room,’ Mrs Dudley said coldly, and Eleanor sensed,
with a quick turn of apprehension, that flippant or critical
talk about the house bothered Mrs Dudley in some manner;
maybe she thinks it can hear us, Eleanor thought, and then
was sorry she had thought it. Perhaps she shivered, because
Theodora turned with a quick smile and touched her
shoulder gently, reassuringly; she is charming, Eleanor
thought, smiling back, not at all the sort of person who
belongs in this dreary, dark place, but then, probably, I
don’t belong here either; I am not the sort of person for
Hill House but I can’t think of anybody who would be.
She laughed then, watching Theodora’s expression as she
stood in the doorway of the green room.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good Lord,’ Theodora said, looking sideways at Eleanor.
‘How perfectly enchanting. A positive bower.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I set dinner on the dining-room sideboard at six sharp,’
Mrs Dudley said. ‘You can serve yourselves. I clear up in
the morning. I have breakfast ready for you at nine. That’s
the way I agreed to do.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re frightened,’ Theodora said, watching Eleanor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I can’t keep the rooms up the way you’d like, but there’s
no one else you could get that would help me. I don’t wait
on people. What I agreed to, it doesn’t mean I wait on
people.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was just when I thought I was all alone,’ Eleanor
said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t stay after six. Not after it begins to get dark.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m here now,’ Theodora said, ‘so it’s all right.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We have a connecting bathroom,’ Eleanor said absurdly.
‘The rooms are exactly alike.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Green dimity curtains hung over the windows in Theodora’s
room, the wallpaper was decked with green garlands,
the bedspread and quilt were green, the marble-topped
dresser and the huge wardrobe were the same. ‘I’ve never
seen such awful places in my <span class="it">life</span>,’ Eleanor said, her voice
rising.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Like the very best hotels,’ Theodora said, ‘or any good
girls’ camp.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I leave before dark comes,’ Mrs Dudley went on.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No one can hear you if you scream in the night,’ Eleanor
told Theodora. She realised that she was clutching at the
door-knob and, under Theodora’s quizzical eye, unclenched
her fingers and walked steadily across the room. ‘We’ll have
to find some way of opening these windows,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So there won’t be anyone around if you need help,’ Mrs
Dudley said. ‘We couldn’t hear you, even in the night. No
one could.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right now?’ Theodora asked, and Eleanor nodded.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No one lives any nearer than the town. No one else will
come any nearer than that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re probably just hungry,’ Theodora said. ‘And I’m
starved myself.’ She set her suitcase on the bed and slipped
off her shoes. ‘<span class="it">Nothing</span>,’ she said, ‘upsets me more than being
hungry; I snarl and snap and burst into tears.’ She lifted
a pair of softly tailored slacks out of the suitcase.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In the night,’ Mrs Dudley said. She smiled. ‘In the dark,’
she said, and closed the door behind her.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a minute Eleanor said, ‘She also walks without
making a sound.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Delightful old body.’ Theodora turned, regarding her
room. ‘I take it back, that about the best hotels,’ she said.
‘It’s a little bit like a boarding school I went to for a while.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Come and see mine,’ Eleanor said. She opened the bathroom
door and led the way into her blue room. ‘I was all
unpacked and thinking about packing again when you
came.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Poor baby. You’re certainly starving. All <span class="it">I</span> could think
of when I got a look at the place from outside was what
fun it would be to stand out there and watch it burn down.
Maybe before we leave .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was terrible, being here alone.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You should have seen that boarding school of mine
during vacations.’ Theodora went back into her own room
and, with the sense of movement and sound in the two
rooms, Eleanor felt more cheerful. She straightened her
clothes on the hangers in the wardrobe and set her books
evenly on the bed-table. ‘You know,’ Theodora called from
the other room, ‘it <span class="it">is</span> kind of like the first day at school;
everything’s ugly and strange, and you don’t know anybody,
and you’re afraid everyone’s going to laugh at your
clothes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor, who had opened the dresser drawer to take out
a pair of slacks, stopped and then laughed and threw the
slacks on the bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Did I understand correctly,’ Theodora went on, ‘that Mrs
Dudley is not going to come if we scream in the night?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was not what she agreed to. Did you meet the amiable
old retainer at the gate?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We had a lovely chat. He said I couldn’t come in and
I said I could and then I tried to run him down with my
car but he jumped. Look, do you think we have to sit around
here in our rooms and wait? I’d like to change into something
comfortable—unless we dress for dinner, do you
think?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I won’t if you won’t.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I won’t if <span class="it">you</span> won’t. They can’t fight both of us. Anyway,
let’s get out of here and go exploring; I would very much
like to get this roof off from over my head.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It gets dark so early, in these hills, with all the trees .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’
Eleanor went to the window again, but there was still sunlight
slanting across the lawn.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It won’t be really dark for nearly an hour. I want to go
outside and roll on the grass.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor chose a red sweater, thinking that in this room
in this house the red of the sweater and the red of the
sandals bought to match it would almost certainly be utterly
at war with each other, although they had been close enough
yesterday in the city. Serves me right anyway, she thought,
for wanting to wear such things; I never did before. But
she looked oddly well, it seemed to her as she stood by
the long mirror on the wardrobe door, almost comfortable.
‘Do you have any idea who else is coming?’ she asked. ‘Or
when?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Doctor Montague.’ Theodora said. ‘I thought he’d be here
before anyone else.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Have you known Doctor Montague long?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Never met him,’ Theodora said. ‘Have you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Never. You almost ready?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All ready.’ Theodora came through the bathroom door
into Eleanor’s room; she is lovely, Eleanor thought, turning
to look; I wish I were lovely. Theodora was wearing a vivid
yellow shirt, and Eleanor laughed and said, ‘You bring more
light into this room than the window.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora came over and regarded herself approvingly in
Eleanor’s mirror. ‘I feel,’ she said, ‘that in this dreary place
it is our duty to look as bright as possible. I approve of your
red sweater; the two of us will be visible from one end of
Hill House to the other.’ Still looking into the mirror, she
asked, ‘I suppose Doctor Montague wrote to you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’ Eleanor was embarrassed. ‘I didn’t know, at first,
whether it was a joke or not. But my brother-in-law checked
up on him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You know,’ Theodora said slowly, ‘up until the last
minute—when I got to the gates, I guess—I never really
thought there <span class="it">would</span> be a Hill House. You don’t go around
expecting things like this to happen.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But some of us go around hoping,’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora laughed and swung around before the mirror
and caught Eleanor’s hand. ‘Fellow babe in the woods,’ she
said, ‘let’s go exploring.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We can’t go far away from the house——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I promise not to go one step farther than you say. Do
you think we have to check in and out with Mrs Dudley?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She probably watches every move we make, anyway; it’s
probably part of what she agreed to.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Agreed to with whom, I wonder? Count Dracula?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You think <span class="it">he</span> lives in Hill House?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think he spends all his week-ends here; I swear I saw
bats in the woodwork downstairs. Follow, follow.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They ran downstairs, moving with colour and life against
the dark woodwork and the clouded light of the stairs, their
feet clattering, and Mrs Dudley stood below and watched
them in silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’re going exploring, Mrs Dudley,’ Theodora said
lightly. ‘We’ll be outside somewhere.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But we’ll be back soon,’ Eleanor added.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I set dinner on the sideboard at six o’clock,’ Mrs Dudley
explained.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor, tugging, got the great front door open; it was
just as heavy as it looked, and she thought, We will really
have to find some easier way to get back in. ‘Leave this
open,’ she said over her shoulder to Theodora. ‘It’s terribly
heavy. Get one of those big vases and prop it open.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora wheeled one of the big stone vases from the
corner of the hall, and they stood it in the doorway and
rested the door against it. The fading sunlight outside was
bright after the darkness of the house, and the air was fresh
and sweet. Behind them Mrs Dudley moved the vase again,
and the big door slammed shut.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Lovable old thing,’ Theodora said to the closed door.
For a moment her face was thin with anger, and Eleanor
thought, I hope she never looks at <span class="it">me</span> like that, and was
surprised, remembering that she was always shy with
strangers, awkward and timid, and yet had come in no more
than half an hour to think of Theodora as close and vital,
someone whose anger would be frightening. ‘I think,’
Eleanor said hesitantly, and relaxed, because when she
spoke Theodora turned and smiled again, ‘I think that
during the daylight hours when Mrs Dudley is around I
shall find myself some absorbing occupation far, far from
the house. Rolling the tennis court, perhaps. Or tending the
grapes in the hothouse.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps you could help Dudley with the gates.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Or look for nameless graves in the nettle-patch.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They were standing by the rail of the verandah; from
there they could see down the drive to the point where it
turned among the trees again, and down over the soft curve
of the hills to the distant small line which might have been
the main highway, the road back to the cities from which
they had come. Except for the wires which ran to the house
from a spot among the trees, there was no evidence that
Hill House belonged in any way to the rest of the world.
Eleanor turned and followed the verandah; it went, apparently,
all around the house. ‘Oh, look,’ she said, turning the
corner.</p>

<p class="pindent">Behind the house the hills were piled in great pressing
masses, flooded with summer green now, rich, and still.
‘It’s why they called it Hill House,’ Eleanor said inadequately.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s altogether Victorian,’ Theodora said. ‘They simply
wallowed in this kind of great billowing overdone sort of
thing and buried themselves in folds of velvet and tassels
and purple plush. Anyone before them or after would have
put this house right up there on <span class="it">top</span> of those hills where it
belongs, instead of snuggling it down here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If it were on top of the hill everyone could see it. I vote
for keeping it well hidden where it is.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All the time I’m here I’m going to be terrified,’ Theodora
said, ‘thinking one of those hills will fall on us.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They don’t fall on you. They just slide down, silently
and secretly, rolling over you while you try to run
away.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you,’ Theodora said in a small voice. ‘What Mrs
Dudley has started you have completed nicely. I shall pack
and go home at once.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Believing her for a minute, Eleanor turned and stared,
and then saw the amusement on her face and thought, She’s
much braver than I am. Unexpectedly—although it was
later to become a familiar note, a recognisable attribute of
what was to mean ‘Theodora’ in Eleanor’s mind—Theodora
caught at Eleanor’s thought, and answered her. ‘Don’t be
so afraid all the time,’ she said and reached out to touch
Eleanor’s cheek with one finger. ‘We never know where our
courage is coming from.’ Then, quickly, she ran down the
steps and out on to the lawn between the tall grouped trees.
‘Hurry,’ she called back, ‘I want to see if there’s a brook
somewhere.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We can’t go too far,’ Eleanor said, following. Like two
children they ran across the grass, both welcoming the
sudden openness of clear spaces after even a little time in
Hill House, their feet grateful for the grass after the solid
floors; with an instinct almost animal, they followed the
sound and smell of water. ‘Over here,’ Theodora said, ‘a
little path.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It led them tantalisingly closer to the sound of the water,
doubling back and forth through the trees, giving them
occasional glimpses down the hill to the driveway, leading
them around out of sight of the house across a rocky
meadow, and always downhill. As they came away from
the house and out of the trees to places where the sunlight
could still find them Eleanor was easier, although she could
see that the sun was dropping disturbingly closer to the
heaped hills. She called to Theodora, but Theodora only
called back, ‘Follow, follow,’ and ran down the path. Suddenly
she stopped, breathless and tottering, on the very
edge of the brook, which had leaped up before her almost
without warning; Eleanor, coming more slowly behind,
caught at her hand and held her back and then, laughing,
they fell together against the bank which sloped sharply
down to the brook.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They like to surprise you around here,’ Theodora said,
gasping.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Serve you right if you went diving in,’ Eleanor said. ‘Running
like that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s pretty, isn’t it?’ The water of the brook moved quickly
in little lighted ripples; on the other side the grass grew
down to the edge of the water and yellow and blue flowers
leaned their heads over; there was a rounded soft hill there,
and perhaps more meadow beyond, and, far away, the
great hills, still catching the light of the sun. ‘It’s pretty,’
Theodora said with finality.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m sure I’ve been here before,’ Eleanor said. ‘In a book
of fairy tales, perhaps.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m sure of it. Can you skip rocks?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This is where the princess comes to meet the magic
golden fish who is really a prince in disguise——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He couldn’t draw much water, that golden fish of yours;
it can’t be more than three inches deep.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There are stepping-stones to go across, and <span class="it">little</span> fish
swimming, tiny ones—minnows?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Princes in disguise, all of them.’ Theodora stretched in
the sun on the bank, and yawned. ‘Tadpoles?’ she suggested.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Minnows. It’s too late for tadpoles, silly, but I bet we
can find frogs’ eggs. I used to catch minnows in my hands
and let them go.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What a farmer’s wife you might have made.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This is a place for picnics, with lunch beside the brook
and hard-boiled eggs.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora laughed. ‘Chicken salad and chocolate cake.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Lemonade in a Thermos bottle. Spilled salt.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora rolled over luxuriously. ‘They’re wrong about
ants, you know. There were almost never ants. Cows, maybe,
but I don’t think I ever <span class="it">did</span> see an ant on a picnic.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Was there always a bull in a field? Did someone always
say, “But we can’t go through that field; that’s where the
bull is”?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora opened one eye. ‘Did you use to have a comic
uncle? Everyone always laughed, whatever he said? And
he used to tell you not to be afraid of the bull—if the bull
came after you all you had to do was grab the ring through
his nose and swing him around your head?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor tossed a pebble into the brook and watched it
sink clearly to the bottom. ‘Did you have a lot of uncles?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thousands. Do you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">After a minute Eleanor said, ‘Oh, yes. Big ones and little
ones and fat ones and thin ones——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Do you have an Aunt Edna?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Aunt Muriel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Kind of thin? Rimless glasses?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A garnet brooch,’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Does she wear a kind of dark red dress to family parties?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Lace cuffs——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then I think we must really be related,’ Theodora said.
‘Did you use to have braces on your teeth?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. Freckles.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I went to that private school where they made me learn
to curtsy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I always had colds all winter long. My mother made me
wear woollen stockings.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">My</span> mother made my brother take me to dances, and I
used to curtsy like mad. My brother still hates me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I fell down during the graduation procession.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I forgot my lines in the operetta.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I used to write poetry.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ Theodora said, I’m positive we’re cousins.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She sat up, laughing, and then Eleanor said, ‘Be quiet;
there’s something moving over there.’ Frozen, shoulders
pressed together, they stared, watching the spot of hillside
across the brook where the grass moved, watching something
unseen move slowly across the bright green hill,
chilling the sunlight and the dancing little brook. ‘What is
it?’ Eleanor said in a breath, and Theodora put a strong
hand on her wrist.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s gone,’ Theodora said clearly, and the sun came back
and it was warm again. ‘It was a rabbit,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I couldn’t see it,’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I saw it the minute you spoke,’ Theodora said firmly.
‘It was a rabbit; it went over the hill and out of sight.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ve been away too long,’ Eleanor said and looked up
anxiously at the sun touching the hilltops. She got up
quickly and found that her legs were stiff from kneeling
on the damp grass.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Imagine two splendid old picnic-going girls like us,’
Theodora said, ‘afraid of a rabbit.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor leaned down and held out a hand to help her up.
‘We’d really better hurry back,’ she said and, because she
did not herself understand her compelling anxiety, added,
‘The others might be there by now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ll have to come back here for a picnic soon,’ Theodora
said, following carefully up the path, which went
steadily uphill. ‘We really must have a good old-fashioned
picnic down by the brook.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We can ask Mrs Dudley to hard-boil some eggs.’ Eleanor
stopped on the path, not turning. ‘Theodora,’ she said, ‘I
don’t think I can, you know. I don’t think I really will be
able to do it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor.’ Theodora put an arm across her shoulders.
‘Would you let them separate us now? Now that we’ve
found out we’re cousins?’</p>

<h2><a name="chap03"></a>THREE</h2>

<p class="noindent">The sun went down smoothly behind the hills, slipping
almost eagerly, at last, into the pillowy masses. There were
already long shadows on the lawn as Eleanor and Theodora
came up the path towards the side verandah of Hill House,
blessedly hiding its mad face in the growing darkness.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There’s someone waiting there,’ Eleanor said, walking
more quickly, and so saw Luke for the first time. Journeys
end in lovers meeting, she thought, and could only say
inadequately, ‘Are you looking for us?’</p>

<p class="pindent">He had come to the verandah rail, looking down at them
in the dusk, and now he bowed with a deep welcoming
gesture, ‘ “These being dead,” ’ he said, ‘ “then dead must
I be.” Ladies, if you are the ghostly inhabitants of Hill
House, I am here for ever.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He’s really kind of silly, Eleanor thought sternly, and
Theodora said, ‘Sorry we weren’t here to meet you; we’ve
been exploring.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A sour old beldame with a face of curds welcomed us,
thank you,’ he said. ‘ “Howdy-do,” she told me, “I hope I
see you alive when I come back in the morning and your
dinner’s on the sideboard.” Saying which, she departed in
a late-model convertible with First and Second Murderers.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mrs Dudley,’ Theodora said. ‘First Murderer must be
Dudley-at-the-gate; I suppose the other was Count Dracula.
A wholesome family.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Since we are listing our cast of characters,’ he said, ‘my
name is Luke Sanderson.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor was startled into speaking. ‘Then you’re one of
the family? The people who own Hill House? Not one of
Doctor Montague’s guests?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am one of the family; some day this stately pile will
belong to me; until then, however, I am here as one of
Doctor Montague’s guests.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora giggled. ‘<span class="it">We</span>,’ she said, ‘are Eleanor and
Theodora, two little girls who were planning a picnic down
by the brook and got scared home by a rabbit.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I go in mortal terror of rabbits,’ Luke agreed politely.
‘May I come if I carry the picnic basket?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You may bring your ukulele and strum to us while we
eat chicken sandwiches. Is Doctor Montague here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He’s inside,’ Luke said, ‘gloating over his haunted house.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They were silent for a minute, wanting to move closer
together, and then Theodora said thinly, ‘It doesn’t sound
so funny, does it, now it’s getting dark?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ladies, welcome.’ And the great front door opened.
‘Come inside. I am Doctor Montague.’</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="pindent">The four of them stood, for the first time, in the wide,
dark entrance hall of Hill House. Around them the house
steadied and located them, above them the hills slept watchfully,
small eddies of air and sound and movement stirred
and waited and whispered, and the centre of consciousness
was somehow the small space where they stood, four
separated people, and looked trustingly at one another.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am very happy that everyone arrived safely, and on
time,’ Doctor Montague said. ‘Welcome, all of you, welcome
to Hill House—although perhaps that sentiment ought to
come more properly from you, my boy? In any case, welcome,
welcome. Luke, my boy, can you make a martini?’</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="pindent">Dr Montague raised his glass and sipped hopefully, and
sighed. ‘Fair,’ he said. ‘Only fair, my boy. To our success
at Hill House, however.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How would one reckon success, exactly, in an affair like
this?’ Luke inquired curiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor laughed. ‘Put it, then,’ he said, ‘that I hope
that all of us will have an exciting visit and my book will
rock my colleagues back on their heels. I cannot call your
visit a vacation, although to some it might seem so, because
I am hopeful of your working—although work, of course,
depends largely upon what is to be done, does it not? Notes,’
he said with relief, as though fixing upon one unshakable
solidity in a world of fog, ‘notes. We will take notes—to
some, a not unbearable task.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So long as no one makes any puns about spirits and
spirits,’ Theodora said, holding out her glass to Luke to be
filled.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Spirits?’ The doctor peered at her. ‘Spirits? Yes, indeed.
Of course, none of <span class="it">us</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ He hesitated, frowning. ‘Certainly
not,’ he said and took three quick agitated sips at his cocktail.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Everything’s so strange,’ Eleanor said. ‘I mean, this
morning I was wondering what Hill House would be like,
and now I can’t believe that it’s real, and we’re here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They were sitting in a small room, chosen by the doctor,
who had led them into it, down a narrow corridor, fumbling
a little at first, but then finding his way. It was not a cosy
room, certainly. It had an unpleasantly high ceiling, and
a narrow tiled fireplace which looked chill in spite of the
fire which Luke had lighted at once; the chairs in which
they sat were rounded and slippery, and the light coming
through the coloured beaded shades of the lamps sent
shadows into the corners. The overwhelming sense of the
room was purple; beneath their feet the carpeting glowed
in dim convoluted patterns, the walls were papered and
gilt, and a marble cupid beamed fatuously down at them
from the mantel. When they were silent for a moment the
quiet weight of the house pressed down from all around
them. Eleanor, wondering if she were really here at all, and
not dreaming of Hill House from some safe spot impossibly
remote, looked slowly and carefully around the room, telling
herself that this was real, these things existed, from the tiles
around the fireplace to the marble cupid; these people were
going to be her friends. The doctor was round and rosy
and bearded and looked as though he might be more suitably
established before a fire in a pleasant little sitting-room,
with a cat on his knee and a rosy little wife to bring him
scones and jam, and yet he was undeniably the Dr Montague
who had guided Eleanor here, a little man both knowledgeable
and stubborn. Across the fire from the doctor was
Theodora, who had gone unerringly to the most nearly comfortable
chair, had wriggled herself into it somehow with
her legs over the arm and her head tucked in against the
back; she was like a cat, Eleanor thought, and clearly a cat
waiting for its dinner. Luke was not still for a minute, but
moved back and forth across the shadows, filling glasses,
stirring the fire, touching the marble cupid; he was bright
in the firelight, and restless. They were all silent, looking
into the fire, lazy after their several journeys, and Eleanor
thought, I am the fourth person in this room; I am one of
them; I belong.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Since we <span class="it">are</span> all here,’ Luke said suddenly, as though
there had been no pause in the conversation, ‘shouldn’t we
get acquainted? We know only names, so far. I know that
it is Eleanor, here, who is wearing a red sweater, and consequently
it must be Theodora who wears yellow——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Doctor Montague has a beard,’ Theodora said, ‘so you
must be Luke.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And you are Theodora,’ Eleanor said, ‘because <span class="it">I</span> am
Eleanor.’ An Eleanor, she told herself triumphantly, who
belongs, who is talking easily, who is sitting by the fire
with her friends.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Therefore <span class="it">you</span> are wearing the red sweater,’ Theodora
explained to her soberly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have no beard,’ Luke said, ‘so <span class="it">he</span> must be Doctor
Montague.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">I</span> have a beard,’ Dr Montague said, pleased, and looked
around at them with a happy beam. ‘My wife,’ he told them,
‘<span class="it">likes</span> a man to wear a beard. Many women, on the other
hand, find a beard distasteful. A clean-shaven man—you’ll
excuse me, my boy—never looks fully dressed, my wife
tells me.’ He held out his glass to Luke.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now that I know which of us is me,’ Luke said, ‘let me
identify myself further. I am, in private life—assuming that
this is public life and the rest of the world <span class="it">is</span> actually private—let
me see, a bullfighter. Yes. A bullfighter.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I love my love with a B,’ Eleanor said in spite of herself,
‘because he is bearded.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Very true.’ Luke nodded at her. ‘That makes me Doctor
Montague. I live in Bangkok, and my hobby is bothering
women.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not at all,’ Dr Montague protested, amused. ‘I live in
Belmont.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora laughed and gave Luke that quick, understanding
glance she had earlier given Eleanor. Eleanor, watching,
thought wryly that it might sometimes be oppressive to be
for long around one so immediately in tune, so perceptive,
as Theodora. ‘I am by profession an artist’s model,’ Eleanor
said quickly, to silence her own thoughts. ‘I live a mad,
abandoned life, draped in a shawl and going from garret
to garret.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Are you heartless and wanton?’ Luke asked. ‘Or are you
one of the fragile creatures who will fall in love with a lord’s
son and pine away?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Losing all your beauty and coughing a good deal?’
Theodora added.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I rather think I have a heart of gold,’ Eleanor said reflectively.
‘At any rate, my affairs are the talk of the cafés.’
Dear me, she thought. Dear me.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Alas,’ Theodora said, ‘I am a lord’s <span class="it">daughter</span>. Ordinarily
I go clad in silk and lace and cloth of gold, but I have
borrowed my maid’s finery to appear among you. I may of
course become so enamoured of the common life that I will
never go back, and the poor girl will have to get herself
new clothes. And you, Doctor Montague?’</p>

<p class="pindent">He smiled in the firelight. ‘A pilgrim. A wanderer.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Truly a congenial little group,’ Luke said approvingly.
‘Destined to be inseparable friends, in fact. A courtesan, a
pilgrim, a princess, and a bullfighter. Hill House has surely
never seen our like.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I will give the honour to Hill House,’ Theodora said. ‘I
have never seen <span class="it">its</span> like.’ She rose, carrying her glass, and
went to examine a bowl of glass flowers. ‘What did they
<span class="it">call</span> this room, do you suppose?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A parlour, perhaps,’ Dr Montague said. ‘Perhaps a
boudoir. I thought we would be more comfortable in here
than in one of the other rooms. As a matter of fact, I think
we ought to regard this room as our centre of operations,
a kind of common room; it may not be cheerful——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of <span class="it">course</span> it’s cheerful,’ Theodora said staunchly. ‘There
is nothing more exhilarating than maroon upholstery and
oak panelling, and what is that in the corner there? A sedan
chair?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tomorrow you will see the <span class="it">other</span> rooms,’ the doctor told
her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If we are going to have this for a rumpus room,’ Luke
said, ‘I propose we move in something to sit on. I cannot
perch for long on anything here; I skid,’ he said confidentially
to Eleanor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tomorrow,’ the doctor said. ‘Tomorrow, as a matter of
fact, we will explore the entire house and arrange things
to please ourselves. And now, if you have all finished, I
suggest that we determine what Mrs Dudley has done about
our dinner.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora moved at once and then stopped, bewildered.
‘Someone is going to have to lead me,’ she said. ‘I can’t
possibly tell where the dining-room is.’ She pointed. ‘<span class="it">That</span>
door leads to the long passage and then into the front hall,’
she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor chuckled. ‘Wrong, my dear. That door leads
to the conservatory.’ He rose to lead the way. ‘<span class="it">I</span> have studied
a map of the house,’ he said complacently, ‘and I believe
that we have only to go through the door here, down the
passage, into the front hall, and across the hall and through
the billiard room to find the dining-room. Not hard,’ he
said, ‘once you get into practice.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why did they mix themselves up so?’ Theodora asked.
‘Why so many little odd rooms?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Maybe they liked to hide from each other,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">I</span> can’t understand why they wanted everything so dark,’
Theodora said. She and Eleanor were following Dr Montague
down the passage, and Luke came behind, lingering
to look into the drawer of a narrow table, and wondering
aloud to himself at the valance of cupid-heads and ribbon-bunches
which topped the panelling in the dark hall.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Some of these rooms are entirely inside rooms,’ the doctor
said from ahead of them. ‘No windows, no access to the
outdoors at all. However, a series of enclosed rooms is not
altogether surprising in a house of this period, particularly
when you recall that what windows they <span class="it">did</span> have were
heavily shrouded with hangings and draperies within, and
shrubbery without. Ah.’ He opened the passage door and
led them into the front hall. ‘Now,’ he said, considering the
doorways opposite, two smaller doors flanking the great
central double door; ‘Now,’ he said, and selected the nearest.
‘The house <span class="it">does</span> have its little oddities,’ he continued,
holding the door so that they might pass through into the
dark room beyond. ‘Luke, come and hold this open so I
can find the dining-room.’ Moving cautiously, he crossed
the dark room and opened a door, and they followed him
into the pleasantest room they had seen so far, more
pleasant, certainly, because of the lights and the sight and
smell of food. ‘I congratulate myself,’ he said, rubbing his
hands happily. ‘I have led you to civilisation through the
uncharted wastes of Hill House.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We ought to make a practice of leaving every door wide
open.’ Theodora glanced nervously over her shoulder. ‘I
<span class="it">hate</span> this wandering around in the dark.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’d have to prop them open with something, then,’
Eleanor said. ‘Every door in this house swings shut when
you let go of it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tomorrow,’ Dr Montague said. ‘I will make a note. Door
stops.’ He moved happily towards the sideboard, where Mrs
Dudley had set a warming oven and an impressive row of
covered dishes. The table was set for four, with a lavish
display of candles and damask and heavy silver.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No stinting, I see,’ Luke said, taking up a fork with a
gesture which would have confirmed his aunt’s worst suspicions.
‘We get the company silver.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think Mrs Dudley is proud of the house,’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She doesn’t intend to give us a poor table, at any rate,’
the doctor said, peering into the warming oven. This is an
excellent arrangement, I think. It gets Mrs Dudley well
away from here before dark and enables us to have our
dinners without her uninviting company.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps,’ Luke said, regarding the plate which he was
filling generously, ‘perhaps I did good Mrs Dudley—why
<span class="it">must</span> I continue to think of her, perversely, as <span class="it">good</span> Mrs
Dudley?—perhaps I really did her an injustice. She said
she hoped to find me alive in the morning, and our dinner
was in the oven; now I suspect that she intended me to
die of gluttony.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What keeps her here?’ Eleanor asked Dr Montague.
‘Why do she and her husband stay on, alone in this house?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘As I understand it, the Dudleys have taken care of Hill
House ever since anyone can remember; certainly the
Sandersons were happy enough to keep them on. But tomorrow——’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora giggled. ‘Mrs Dudley is probably the only true
surviving member of the family to whom Hill House <span class="it">really</span>
belongs. <span class="it">I</span> think she is only waiting until all the Sanderson
heirs—that’s you, Luke—die off in various horrible ways,
and then she gets the house and the fortune in jewels buried
in the cellar. Or maybe she and Dudley hoard their gold in
the secret chamber, or there’s oil under the house.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There are no secret chambers in Hill House,’ the doctor
said with finality. ‘Naturally, that possibility has been
suggested before, and I think I may say with assurance that
no such romantic devices exist here. But tomorrow——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In any case, oil is definitely old hat, nothing at all to
discover on the property these days,’ Luke told Theodora.
‘The very least Mrs Dudley could murder me for in cold
blood is uranium.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Or just the pure fun of it,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ Eleanor said, ‘but why are we here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">For a long minute the three of them looked at her, Theodora
and Luke curiously, the doctor gravely. Then Theodora
said, ‘Just what <span class="it">I</span> was going to ask. Why <span class="it">are</span> we here? What
<span class="it">is</span> wrong with Hill House? What is going to happen?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tomorrow——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ Theodora said, almost petulantly. ‘We are three
adult, intelligent people. We have all come a long way,
Doctor Montague, to meet you here in Hill House; Eleanor
wants to know why, and so do I.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Me too,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why did you bring us here, Doctor? Why are you here
yourself? How did you hear about Hill House, and why
does it have such a reputation and what really goes on here?
What is going to <span class="it">happen</span>?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor frowned unhappily. ‘I don’t know,’ he said,
and then, when Theodora made a quick, irritated gesture,
he went on, ‘I know very little more about the house than
you do, and naturally I intended to tell you everything I
do know; as for what is going to <span class="it">happen</span>, I will learn that
when you do. But tomorrow is soon enough to talk about
it, I think; daylight——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not for me,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I assure you,’ the doctor said, ‘that Hill House will be
quiet tonight. There is a pattern to these things, as though
psychic phenomena were subject to laws of a very particular
sort.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I really think we ought to talk it over tonight,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’re not afraid,’ Eleanor added.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor sighed again. ‘Suppose,’ he said slowly, ‘you
heard the story of Hill House and decided not to stay. How
would you leave, tonight?’ He looked around at them again,
quickly. ‘The gates are locked. Hill House has a reputation
for insistent hospitality; it seemingly dislikes letting its
guests get away. The last person who tried to leave Hill
House in darkness—it was eighteen years ago, I grant you—was
killed at the turn in the driveway, where his horse
bolted and crushed him against the big tree. Suppose I
tell you about Hill House, and one of you wants to leave?
Tomorrow, at least, we could see that you got safely to
the village.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But we’re not going to run away,’ Theodora said. ‘I’m
not, and Eleanor isn’t, and Luke isn’t.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Stoutly, upon the ramparts,’ Luke agreed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You are a mutinous group of assistants. After dinner,
then. We will retire to our little boudoir for coffee and a
little of the good brandy Luke has in his suitcase, and I will
tell you all I know about Hill House. Now, however, let
us talk about music, or painting, or even politics.’</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘I had not decided,’ the doctor said, turning the brandy
in his glass, ‘how best to prepare the three of you for Hill
House. I certainly could not write you about it, and I am
most unwilling now to influence your minds with its complete
history before you have had a chance to see for yourselves.’
They were back in the small parlour, warm and almost
sleepy. Theodora had abandoned any attempt at a chair
and had put herself down on the hearthrug, cross-legged
and drowsy. Eleanor, wanting to sit on the hearthrug beside
her, had not thought of it in time and had condemned
herself to one of the slippery chairs, unwilling now to attract
attention by moving and getting herself awkwardly down
on to the floor. Mrs Dudley’s good dinner and an hour’s
quiet conversation had evaporated the faint air of unreality
and constraint; they had begun to know one another, recognise
individual voices and mannerisms, faces and laughter;
Eleanor thought with a little shock of surprise that she had
been in Hill House only for four or five hours, and smiled
a little at the fire. She could feel the thin stem of her glass
between her fingers, the stiff pressure of the chair against
her back, the faint movements of air through the room
which were barely perceptible in small stirrings of tassels
and beads. Darkness lay in the corners, and the marble
cupid smiled down on them with chubby good humour.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What a time for a ghost story,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If you please.’ The doctor was stiff. ‘We are not children
trying to frighten one another,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sorry.’ Theodora smiled up at him. ‘I’m just trying to
get myself used to all of this.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Let us,’ said the doctor, ‘exercise great caution in our
language. Preconceived notions of ghosts and apparitions——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The disembodied hand in the soup,’ Luke said helpfully.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear boy. <span class="it">If</span> you please. I was trying to explain that
our purpose here, since it is of a scientific and exploratory
nature, ought not to be affected, perhaps even warped, by
half-remembered spooky stories which belong more properly
to a—let me see—a marshmallow roast.’ Pleased with
himself, he looked around to be sure that they were all
amused. ‘As a matter of fact, my researches over the past
few years have led me to certain theories regarding psychic
phenomena which I have now, for the first time, an opportunity
of testing. Ideally, of course, you ought not to know
anything about Hill House. You should be ignorant and
receptive.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And take notes,’ Theodora murmured.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Notes. Yes, indeed. Notes. However, I realise that it is
most impractical to leave you entirely without background
information, largely because you are not people accustomed
to meeting a situation without preparation.’ He beamed at
them slyly. ‘You are three wilful, spoiled children who are
prepared to nag me for your bedtime story.’ Theodora
giggled, and the doctor nodded at her happily. He rose and
moved to stand by the fire in an unmistakable classroom
pose; he seemed to feel the lack of a blackboard behind him,
because once or twice he half turned, hand raised, as though
looking for chalk to illustrate a point. ‘Now,’ he said, ‘we
will take up the history of Hill House.’ I wish I had a notebook
and a pen, Eleanor thought, just to make him feel at
home. She glanced at Theodora and Luke and found both
their faces fallen instinctively into a completely rapt classroom
look; high earnestness, she thought; we have moved
into another stage of our adventure.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You will recall,’ the doctor began, ‘the houses described
in Leviticus as “leprous,” <span class="it">tsaraas</span>, or Homer’s phrase for
the underworld: <span class="it">aidao domos</span>, the house of Hades; I need
not remind you, I think, that the concept of certain houses
as unclean or forbidden—perhaps sacred—is as old as the
mind of man. Certainly there are spots which inevitably
attach to themselves an atmosphere of holiness and goodness;
it might not then be too fanciful to say that some
houses are born bad. Hill House, whatever the cause, has
been unfit for human habitation for upwards of twenty
years. What it was like before then, whether its personality
was moulded by the people who lived here, or the things
they did, or whether it was evil from its start are all
questions I cannot answer. Naturally I hope that we
will all know a good deal more about Hill House before
we leave. No one knows, even, why some houses are called
haunted.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What else <span class="it">could</span> you call Hill House?’ Luke demanded.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well—disturbed, perhaps. Leprous. Sick. Any of the
popular euphemisms for insanity; a deranged house is a
pretty conceit. There are popular theories, however, which
discount the eerie, the mysterious; there are people who
will tell you that the disturbances I am calling “psychic” are
actually the result of subterranean waters, or electric currents,
or hallucinations caused by polluted air; atmospheric
pressure, sun spots, earth tremors all have their advocates
among the sceptical. People,’ the doctor said sadly, ‘are
always so anxious to get things out into the open where
they can put a name to them, even a meaningless name, so
long as it has something of a scientific ring.’ He sighed,
relaxing, and gave them a little quizzical smile. ‘A haunted
house,’ he said. ‘Everyone laughs. I found myself telling
my colleagues at the university that I was going camping
this summer.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I told people I was participating in a scientific experiment,’
Theodora said helpfully. ‘Without telling them where
or what, of course.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Presumably your friends feel less strongly about scientific
experiments than mine. Yes.’ The doctor sighed again.
‘Camping. At my age. And yet <span class="it">that</span> they believed. Well.’ He
straightened up again and fumbled at his side, perhaps for
a yardstick. ‘I first heard about Hill House a year ago, from
a former tenant. He began by assuring me that he had left
Hill House because his family objected to living so far out
in the country, and ended by saying that in his opinion the
house ought to be burned down and the ground sowed with
salt. I learned of other people who had rented Hill House,
and found that none of them had stayed more than a few
days, certainly never the full terms of their leases, giving
reasons that ranged from the dampness of the location—not
at all true, by the way; the house is very dry—to a
pressing need to move elsewhere, for business reasons. That
is, every tenant who has left Hill House hastily has made
an effort to supply a rational reason for leaving, and yet
every one of them has left. I tried, of course, to learn more
from these former tenants, and yet in no case could I persuade
them to discuss the house; they all seemed most
unwilling to give me information and were, in fact, reluctant
to recall the details of their several stays. In only one opinion
were they united. Without exception, every person who has
spent any length of time in this house urged me to stay
as far away from it as possible. Not one of the former tenants
could bring himself to admit that Hill House was haunted,
but when I visited Hillsdale and looked up the newspaper
records——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Newspapers?’ Theodora asked. ‘Was there a scandal?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, yes,’ the doctor said. ‘A perfectly splendid scandal,
with a suicide and madness and lawsuits. <span class="it">Then</span> I learned
that the local people had no doubts about the house. I heard
a dozen different stories, of course—it is really <span class="it">unbelievably</span>
difficult to get accurate information about a haunted house;
it would astonish you to know what I have gone through
to learn only as much as I have—and as a result I went
to Mrs Sanderson, Luke’s aunt, and arranged to rent Hill
House. She was most frank about its undesirability——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s harder to burn down a house than you think,’ Luke
said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘—but agreed to allow me a short lease to carry out my
researches, on condition that a member of the family be
one of my party.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They hope,’ Luke said solemnly, ‘that I will dissuade you
from digging up the lovely old scandals.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There. Now I have explained how I happen to be here,
and why Luke has come. As for you two ladies, we all know
by now that you are here because I wrote you, and you
accepted my invitation. I hoped that each of you might,
in her own way, intensify the forces at work in the house;
Theodora has shown herself possessed of some telepathic
ability, and Eleanor has in the past been intimately involved
in poltergeist phenomena——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">I?</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course.’ The doctor looked at her curiously. ‘Many
years ago, when you were a child. The stones——’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor frowned, and shook her head. Her fingers
trembled around the stem of her glass, and then she said,
‘That was the neighbours. My mother said the neighbours
did that. People are always jealous.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps so.’ The doctor spoke quietly and smiled at
Eleanor. ‘The incident has been forgotten long ago, of
course; I only mentioned it because that is why I wanted
you in Hill House.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘When <span class="it">I</span> was a child,’ Theodora said lazily, ‘——“many
years ago,” Doctor, as you put it so tactfully—I was whipped
for throwing a brick through a greenhouse roof. I remember
I thought about it for a long time, remembering the whipping
but remembering also the lovely crash, and after
thinking about it very seriously I went out and did it again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t remember very well,’ Eleanor said uncertainly
to the doctor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But <span class="it">why</span>? Theodora asked. ‘I mean, I can accept that
Hill House is supposed to be haunted, and you want us here,
Doctor Montague, to help keep track of what happens—and
I bet besides that you wouldn’t at all like being here
<span class="it">alone</span>—but I just don’t understand. It’s a horrible old house,
and if I rented it I’d scream for my money back after one
fast look at the front hall, but what’s <span class="it">here</span>? What really
frightens people so?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I will not put a name to what has no name,’ the doctor
said. ‘I don’t know.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They never even told me what was going on,’ Eleanor
said urgently to the doctor. ‘My mother said it was the
neighbours, they were always against us because she
wouldn’t mix with them. My mother——’</p>

<p class="pindent">Luke interrupted her, slowly and deliberately. ‘I think,’
he said, ‘that what we all want is facts. Something we can
understand and put together.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘First,’ the doctor said, ‘I am going to ask you all a question.
Do you want to leave? Do you advise that we pack
up now and leave Hill House to itself, and never have
anything more to do with it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked at Eleanor, and Eleanor put her hands together
tight; it is another chance to get away, she was thinking,
and she said, ‘No,’ and glanced with embarrassment at
Theodora. ‘I was kind of a baby this afternoon,’ she explained.
‘I did let myself get frightened.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She’s not telling all the truth,’ Theodora said loyally. ‘She
wasn’t any more frightened than I was; we scared each
other to death over a rabbit.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Horrible creatures, rabbits,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor laughed. ‘I suppose we were all nervous this
afternoon, anyway. It is a rude shock to turn that corner
and get a clear look at Hill House.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I thought he was going to send the car into a tree,’ Luke
said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am really very brave now, in a warm room with a fire
and company,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t think we could leave now if we wanted to.’
Eleanor had spoken before she realised clearly what she
was going to say, or what it was going to sound like to the
others; she saw that they were staring at her, and laughed
and added lamely, ‘Mrs Dudley would never forgive us.’
She wondered if they really believed that that was what
she had meant to say, and thought, Perhaps it has us now,
this house, perhaps it will not let us go.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Let us have a little more brandy,’ the doctor said, ‘and
I will tell you the story of Hill House.’ He returned to his
classroom position before the fireplace and began slowly, as
one giving an account of kings long dead and wars long
done with; his voice was carefully unemotional. ‘Hill House
was built eighty-odd years ago,’ he began. ‘It was built as
a home for his family by a man named Hugh Crain, a
country home where he hoped to see his children and grandchildren
live in comfortable luxury, and where he fully expected
to end his days in quiet. Unfortunately Hill House
was a sad house almost from the beginning; Hugh Crain’s
young wife died minutes before she first was to set eyes on
the house, when the carriage bringing her here overturned
in the driveway, and the lady was brought—ah, <span class="it">lifeless</span>, I
believe is the phrase they use—into the home her husband
had built for her. He was a sad and bitter man, Hugh Crain,
left with two small daughters to bring up, but he did not
leave Hill House.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Children grew up here?’ Eleanor asked incredulously.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor smiled. ‘The house is dry, as I said. There were
no swamps to bring them fevers, the country air was thought
to be beneficial to them, and the house itself was regarded
as luxurious. I have no doubt that two small children could
play here, lonely perhaps, but not unhappy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hope they went wading in the brook,’ Theodora said.
She stared deeply into the fire. ‘Poor little things. I hope
someone let them run in that meadow and pick wildflowers.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Their father married again,’ the doctor went on. ‘Twice
more, as a matter of fact. He seems to have been—unlucky
in his wives. The second Mrs Crain died of a fall, although
I have been unable to ascertain how or why. Her death
seems to have been as tragically unexpected as her predecessor’s.
The third Mrs Crain died of what they used to
call consumption, somewhere in Europe; there is, somewhere
in the library, a collection of postcards sent to the
two little girls left behind in Hill House from their father
and their stepmother travelling from one health resort to
another. The little girls were left here with their governess
until their stepmother’s death. After that Hugh Crain declared
his intention of closing Hill House and remaining
abroad, and his daughters were sent to live with a cousin
of their mother’s, and there they remained until they were
grown up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hope Mama’s cousin was a little jollier than old Hugh,’
Theodora said, still staring darkly into the fire. ‘It’s not nice
to think of children growing up like mushrooms, in the
dark.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They felt differently,’ the doctor said. ‘The two sisters
spent the rest of their lives quarrelling over Hill House.
After all his high hopes of a dynasty centred here, Hugh
Crain died somewhere in Europe, shortly after his wife,
and Hill House was left jointly to the two sisters, who must
have been quite young ladies by then; the older sister had,
at any rate, made her début into society.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And put up her hair, and learned to drink champagne
and carry a fan .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hill House was empty for a number of years, but kept
always in readiness for the family; at first in expectation
of Hugh Crain’s return, and then, after his death, for either
of the sisters who chose to live there. Somewhere during
this time it was apparently agreed between the two sisters
that Hill House should become the property of the older;
the younger sister had married——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Aha,’ Theodora said. ‘The <span class="it">younger</span> sister married. Stole
her sister’s beau, I’ve no doubt.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was said that the older sister was crossed in love,’ the
doctor agreed, ‘although that is said of almost any lady
who prefers, for whatever reason, to live alone. At any rate,
it was the older sister who came back here to live. She
seems to have resembled her father strongly; she lived here
alone for a number of years, almost in seclusion, although
the village of Hillsdale knew her. Incredible as it may
sound to you, she genuinely loved Hill House and looked
upon it as her family home. She eventually took a girl from
the village to live with her, as a kind of companion; so far
as I can learn there seems to have been no strong feeling
among the villagers about the house then, since old Miss
Crain—as she was inevitably known—hired her servants
in the village, and it was thought a fine thing for her to
take the village girl as a companion. Old Miss Crain was
in constant disagreement with her sister over the house,
the younger sister insisting that she had given up her claim
on the house in exchange for a number of family heirlooms,
some of considerable value, which her sister then refused
to give her. There were some jewels, several pieces of
antique furniture, and a set of gold-rimmed dishes, which
seemed to irritate the younger sister more than anything
else. Mrs Sanderson let me rummage through a box of family
papers, and so I have seen some of the letters Miss Crain
received from her sister, and in all of them those dishes
stand out as the recurrent sore subject. At any rate, the
older sister died of pneumonia here in the house, with only
the little companion to help her—there were stories later
of a doctor called too late, of the old lady lying neglected
upstairs while the younger woman dallied in the garden
with some village lout, but I suspect that these are only
scandalous inventions; I certainly cannot find that anything
of the sort was widely believed at the time, and in fact
most of the stories seem to stem directly from the poisonous
vengefulness of the younger sister, who never rested in her
anger.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t like the younger sister,’ Theodora said. ‘First she
stole her sister’s lover, and then she tried to steal her sister’s
dishes. No, I don’t like her.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hill House has an impressive list of tragedies connected
with it, but then, most old houses have. People have to live
and die <span class="it">somewhere</span>, after all, and a house can hardly stand
for eighty years without seeing some of its inhabitants die
within its walls. After the death of the older sister, there
was a lawsuit over the house. The companion insisted that
the house was left to her, but the younger sister and her
husband maintained most violently that the house belonged
legally to them and claimed that the companion had tricked
the older sister into signing away property which she had
always intended leaving to her sister. It was an unpleasant
business, like all family quarrels, and as in all family quarrels
incredibly harsh and cruel things were said on either side.
The companion swore in court—and here, I think, is the first
hint of Hill House in its true personality—that the younger
sister came into the house at night and stole things. When
she was pressed to enlarge upon this accusation, she became
very nervous and incoherent, and finally, forced to give
some evidence for her charge, said that a silver service was
missing, and a valuable set of enamels, in addition to the
famous set of gold-rimmed dishes, which would actually
be a very difficult thing to steal, when you think about it.
For her part, the younger sister went so far as to mention
murder and demand an investigation into the death of old
Miss Crain, bringing up the first hints of the stories of
neglect and mismanagement. I cannot discover that these
suggestions were ever taken seriously. There is no record
whatever of any but the most formal notice of the older
sister’s death, and certainly the villagers would have been
the first to wonder if there had been any oddness about
the death. The companion won her case at last, and could,
in my opinion, have won a case for slander besides, and
the house became legally hers, although the younger sister
never gave up trying to get it. She kept after the unfortunate
companion with letters and threats, made the wildest
accusations against her everywhere, and in the local police
records there is listed at least one occasion when the companion
was forced to apply for police protection to prevent
her enemy from attacking her with a broom. The companion
went in terror, seemingly; her house burgled at
night—she never stopped insisting that they came and stole
things—and I read one pathetic letter in which she complained
that she had not spent a peaceful night in the house
since the death of her benefactress. Oddly enough, sympathy
around the village was almost entirely with the younger
sister, perhaps because the companion, once a village girl,
was now lady of the manor. The villagers believed—and
still believe, I think—that the younger sister was defrauded
of her inheritance by a scheming young woman. They did
not believe that she would murder her friend, you see, but
they were delighted to believe that she was dishonest,
certainly because they were capable of dishonesty themselves
when opportunity arose. Well, gossip is always a bad
enemy. When the poor creature killed herself——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Killed herself?’ Eleanor, shocked into speech, half rose.
‘She had to kill herself?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You mean, was there another way of escaping her tormentor?
She certainly did not seem to think so. It was
accepted locally that she had chosen suicide because her
guilty conscience drove her to it. I am more inclined to
believe that she was one of those tenacious, unclever young
women who can hold on desperately to what they believe
is their own but cannot withstand, mentally, a constant nagging
persecution; she had certainly no weapons to fight back
against the younger sister’s campaign of hatred, her own
friends in the village had been turned against her, and she
seems to have been maddened by the conviction that locks
and bolts could not keep out the enemy who stole into her
house at night——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She should have gone away,’ Eleanor said. ‘Left the
house and run as far as she could go.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In effect, she did. I really think the poor girl was hated
to death; she hanged herself, by the way. Gossip says she
hanged herself from the turret on the tower, but when you
have a house like Hill House with a tower and a turret,
gossip would hardly allow you to hang yourself anywhere
else. After her death, the house passed legally into the hands
of the Sanderson family, who were cousins of hers and in
no way as vulnerable to the persecutions of the younger
sister, who must have been a little demented herself by that
time. I heard from Mrs Sanderson that when the family—it
would have been her husband’s parents—first came to see
the house, the younger sister showed up to abuse them,
standing on the road to howl at them as they went by, and
found herself packed right off to the local police station.
And that seems to be the end of the younger sister’s part in
the story: from the day the first Sanderson sent her packing
to the brief notice of her death a few years later, she seems
to have spent her time brooding silently over her wrongs,
but far away from the Sandersons. Oddly enough, in all her
ranting, she insisted always on one point—she had not,
would not, come into this house at night, to steal or for
any other reason.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Was anything ever really stolen?’ Luke asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘As I told you, the companion was finally pressed into
saying that one or two things seemed to be missing, but
could not say for sure. As you can imagine, the story of the
nightly intruder did a good deal to enhance Hill House’s
further reputation. Moreover, the Sandersons did not live
here at all. They spent a few days in the house, telling the
villagers that they were preparing it for their immediate
occupancy, and then abruptly cleared out, closing the house
the way it stood. They told around the village that urgent
business took them to live in the city, but the villagers
thought they knew better. No one has lived in the house
since for more than a few days at a time. It has been on
the market, for sale or rent, ever since. Well, that is a long
story. I need more brandy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Those two poor little girls,’ Eleanor said, looking into the
fire. ‘I can’t forget them, walking through these dark rooms,
trying to play dolls, maybe, in here or those bedrooms
upstairs.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And so the old house has just been sitting here.’ Luke
put out a tentative finger and touched the marble cupid
gingerly. ‘Nothing in it touched, nothing used, nothing here
wanted by anyone any more, just sitting here thinking.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And waiting,’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And waiting,’ the doctor confirmed. ‘Essentially,’ he went
on slowly, ‘the evil is the house itself, I think. It has enchained
and destroyed its people and their lives, it is a
place of contained ill will. Well. Tomorrow you will see it
all. The Sandersons put in electricity and plumbing and a
telephone when they first thought to live here, but otherwise
nothing has been changed.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well,’ Luke said after a little silence, ‘I’m sure we will
all be very comfortable here.’</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor found herself unexpectedly admiring her own
feet. Theodora dreamed over the fire just beyond the tips
of her toes, and Eleanor thought with deep satisfaction that
her feet were handsome in their red sandals; what a complete
and separate thing I am, she thought, going from my
red toes to the top of my head, individually an I, possessed
of attributes belonging only to me. I have red shoes, she
thought—that goes with being Eleanor; I dislike lobster and
sleep on my left side and crack my knuckles when I am
nervous and save buttons. I am holding a brandy glass which
is mine because I am here and I am using it and I have a
place in this room. I have red shoes and tomorrow I will
wake up and I will still be here.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have red shoes,’ she said very softly, and Theodora
turned and smiled up at her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I <span class="it">had</span> intended——’ and the doctor looked around at them
with bright, anxious optimism—‘I <span class="it">had</span> intended to ask if
you all played bridge?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course,’ Eleanor said. I play bridge, she thought; I
used to have a cat named Dancer; I can swim.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m afraid not,’ Theodora said, and the other three turned
and regarded her with frank dismay.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not at all?’ the doctor asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve been playing bridge twice a week for eleven years,’
Eleanor said, ‘with my mother and her lawyer and his wife—I’m
<span class="it">sure</span> you must play as well as <span class="it">that</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Maybe you could teach me?’ Theodora asked. ‘I’m quick
at learning games.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, dear,’ the doctor said, and Eleanor and Luke laughed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ll do something else instead,’ Eleanor said; I can play
bridge, she thought; I like apple pie with sour cream, and
I drove here by myself.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Backgammon,’ the doctor said with bitterness.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I play a fair game of chess,’ Luke said to the doctor, who
cheered at once.</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora set her mouth stubbornly. ‘I didn’t suppose we
came here to play <span class="it">games</span>,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Relaxation,’ the doctor said vaguely, and Theodora turned
with a sullen shrug and stared again into the fire.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll get the chessmen, if you’ll tell me where,’ Luke said,
and the doctor smiled.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Better let me go,’ he said. ‘I’ve studied a floor plan of the
house, remember. If we let you go off wandering by yourself
we’d very likely never find you again.’ As the door closed
behind him Luke gave Theodora a quick curious glance
and then came over to stand by Eleanor. ‘You’re not nervous,
are you? Did that story frighten you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor shook her head emphatically, and Luke said, ‘You
looked pale.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I probably ought to be in bed,’ Eleanor said. I’m not used
to driving as far as I did today.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Brandy,’ Luke said. ‘It will make you sleep better. You
too,’ he said to the back of Theodora’s head.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you,’ Theodora said coldly, not turning. ‘I rarely
have trouble sleeping.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Luke grinned knowingly at Eleanor, and then turned as
the doctor opened the door. ‘My wild imagination,’ the
doctor said, setting down the chess set. ‘What a house this
is.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Did something happen?’ Eleanor asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor shook his head. ‘We probably ought to agree,
now, not to wander around the house alone,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What happened?’ Eleanor asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My own imagination,’ the doctor said firmly. ‘This table
all right, Luke?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s a lovely old chess set,’ Luke said. ‘I wonder how the
younger sister happened to overlook it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I can tell you one thing,’ the doctor said, ‘if it <span class="it">was</span> the
younger sister sneaking around this house at night, she had
nerves of iron. It watches,’ he added suddenly. ‘The house.
It watches every move you make.’ And then, ‘My own
imagination, of course.’</p>

<p class="pindent">In the light of the fire Theodora’s face was stiff and sulky;
she likes attention, Eleanor thought wisely and, without
thinking, moved and sat on the floor beside Theodora.
Behind her she could hear the gentle sound of chessmen
being set down on a board and the comfortable small movements
of Luke and the doctor taking each other’s measure,
and in the fire there were points of flame and little stirrings.
She waited a minute for Theodora to speak, and then said
agreeably, ‘Still hard to believe you’re really here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I had no idea it would be so dull,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ll find plenty to do in the morning,’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘At home there would be people around, and lots of
talking and laughing and lights and excitement——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I suppose I don’t need such things,’ Eleanor said, almost
apologetically. ‘There never was much excitement for me.
I had to stay with Mother, of course. And when she was
asleep I kind of got used to playing solitaire or listening
to the radio. I never could bear to read in the evenings
because I had to read aloud to her for two hours every
afternoon. Love stories’—and she smiled a little, looking into
the fire. But that’s not all, she thought, astonished at herself,
that doesn’t tell what it was like, even if I wanted to
tell; why am I talking?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m terrible, aren’t I?’ Theodora moved quickly and put
her hand over Eleanor’s. ‘I sit here and grouch because
there’s nothing to amuse me; I’m very selfish. Tell me how
horrible I am.’ And in the firelight her eyes shone with
delight.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re horrible,’ Eleanor said obediently; Theodora’s
hand on her own embarrassed her. She disliked being
touched, and yet a small physical gesture seemed to be
Theodora’s chosen way of expressing contrition, or pleasure,
or sympathy; I wonder if my fingernails are clean, Eleanor
thought, and slid her hand away gently.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am horrible,’ Theodora said, good-humoured again. ‘I’m
horrible and beastly and no one can stand me. There. Now
tell me about yourself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m horrible and beastly and no one can stand me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora laughed. ‘Don’t make fun of me. You’re sweet
and pleasant and everyone likes you very much; Luke has
fallen madly in love with you, and I am jealous. Now I
want to know more about you. Did you really take care
of your mother for many years?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ Eleanor said. Her fingernails <span class="it">were</span> dirty, and her
hand was badly shaped and people made jokes about love
because sometimes it was funny. ‘Eleven years, until she
died three months ago.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Were you sorry when she died? Should I say how sorry
<span class="it">I</span> am?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. She wasn’t very happy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And neither were you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And neither was I.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But what about now? What did you do afterwards, when
you were free at last?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I sold the house,’ Eleanor said. ‘My sister and I each
took whatever we wanted from it, small things; there was
really nothing much except little things my mother had
saved—my father’s watch, and some old jewellery. Not at
all like the sisters of Hill House.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And you sold everything else?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Everything. Just as soon as I could.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And then of course you started a gay, mad fling that
brought you inevitably to Hill House?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not exactly.’ Eleanor laughed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But all those wasted years! Did you go on a cruise, look
for exciting young men, buy new clothes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Unfortunately,’ Eleanor said dryly, ‘there was not at all
that much money. My sister put her share into the bank for
her little girl’s education. I did buy some clothes, to come
to Hill House.’ People like answering questions about themselves,
she thought; what an odd pleasure it is. I would
answer anything right now.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What will you do when you go back? Do you have a
job?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">No</span>, no job right now. I don’t know what I’m going to do.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I know what <span class="it">I</span>’ll do.’ Theodora stretched luxuriously. ‘I’ll
turn on every light in our apartment and just bask.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What is your apartment like?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora shrugged. ‘Nice,’ she said. ‘We found an old
place and fixed it up ourselves. One big room, and a couple
of small bedrooms, nice kitchen—we painted it red and
white and made over a lot of old furniture we dug up in
junk shops—one really nice table, with a marble top. We
both love doing over old things.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Are you married?’ Eleanor asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a little silence, and then Theodora laughed
quickly and said, ‘No.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sorry,’ Eleanor said, horribly embarrassed. ‘I didn’t mean
to be curious.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re funny,’ Theodora said and touched Eleanor’s
cheek with her finger. There are lines by my eyes, Eleanor
thought, and turned her face away from the fire. ‘Tell me
where you live,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor thought, looking down at her hands which were
badly shaped. We could have afforded a laundress, she
thought; it wasn’t fair. My hands are awful. ‘I have a little
place of my own,’ she said slowly. ‘An apartment, like yours,
only I live alone. Smaller than yours, I’m sure. I’m still
furnishing it—buying one thing at a time, you know, to
make sure I get everything absolutely right. White curtains.
I had to look for weeks before I found my little stone lions
on each corner of the mantel, and I have a white cat and
my books and records and pictures. Everything has to be
exactly the way I want it, because there’s only me to use
it; once I had a blue cup with stars painted on the inside;
when you looked down into a cup of tea it was full of stars.
I want a cup like that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Maybe one will turn up some day, in my shop,’ Theodora
said. ‘Then I can send it to you. Some day you’ll get a little
package saying “To Eleanor with love from her friend
Theodora,” and it will be a blue cup full of stars.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I would have stolen those gold-rimmed dishes,’ Eleanor
said, laughing.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mate,’ Luke said, and the doctor said, ‘Oh dear, oh dear.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Blind luck,’ Luke said cheerfully. ‘Have you ladies fallen
asleep there by the fire?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just about,’ Theodora said. Luke came across the room
and held out a hand to each of them to help them up, and
Eleanor, moving awkwardly, almost fell; Theodora rose in
a quick motion and stretched and yawned. ‘Theo is sleepy,’
she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll have to lead you upstairs,’ the doctor said. ‘Tomorrow
we must really start to learn our way around. Luke, will
you screen the fire?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Had we better make sure that the doors are locked?’ Luke
asked. ‘I imagine that Mrs Dudley locked the back door
when she left, but what about the others?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hardly think we’ll catch anyone breaking in,’ Theodora
said. ‘Anyway, the little companion used to lock her doors,
and what good did it do her?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Suppose we want to break out?’ Eleanor asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor glanced quickly at Eleanor and then away.
‘I see no need for locking doors,’ he said quietly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There is certainly not much danger of burglars from the
village,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In any case,’ the doctor said, ‘I will not sleep for an hour
or so yet; at my age an hour’s reading before bedtime is
essential, and I wisely brought <span class="it">Pamela</span> with me. If any of
you has trouble sleeping, I will read aloud to you. I never
yet knew anyone who could not fall asleep with Richardson
being read aloud to him.’ Talking quietly, he led them down
the narrow hallway and through the great front hall and to
the stairs. ‘I have often planned to try it on very small
children,’ he went on.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor followed Theodora up the stairs; she had not
realised until now how worn she was, and each step was
an effort. She reminded herself naggingly that she was in
Hill House, but even the blue room meant only, right now,
the bed with the blue coverlet and the blue quilt. ‘On the
other hand,’ the doctor continued behind her, ‘a Fielding
novel comparable in length, although hardly in subject-matter,
would never do for very young children. I even have
doubts about Sterne——’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora went to the door of the green room and turned
and smiled. ‘If you feel the least bit nervous,’ she said to
Eleanor, ‘run right into my room.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I will,’ Eleanor said earnestly. ‘Thank you; good night.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘—and certainly not Smollett. Ladies, Luke and I are here,
on the other side of the stairway——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What colour are your rooms?’ Eleanor asked, unable to
resist.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yellow,’ the doctor said, surprised.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Pink,’ Luke said with a dainty gesture of distaste.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’re blue and green down here,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I will be awake, reading,’ the doctor said. ‘I will leave
my door ajar, so I will certainly hear any sound. Good night.
Sleep well.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good night,’ Luke said. ‘Good night, all.’</p>

<p class="pindent">As she closed the door of the blue room behind her
Eleanor thought wearily that it might be the darkness and
oppression of Hill House that tired her so, and then it no
longer mattered. The blue bed was unbelievably soft. Odd,
she thought sleepily, that the house should be so dreadful
and yet in many respects so physically comfortable—the
soft bed, the pleasant lawn, the good fire, the cooking of
Mrs Dudley. The company too, she thought, and then
thought, Now I can think about them; I am all alone. Why
is Luke here? But why am <span class="it">I</span> here? Journeys end in lovers
meeting. They all saw that I was afraid.</p>

<p class="pindent">She shivered and sat up in bed to reach for the quilt at
the foot. Then, half amused and half cold, she slipped out
of bed and went, barefoot and silent, across the room to
turn the key in the lock of the door; they won’t know I
locked it, she thought, and went hastily back to bed. With
the quilt pulled up around her she found herself looking
with quick apprehension at the window, shining palely in
the darkness, and then at the door. I wish I had a sleeping
pill to take, she thought, and looked again over her shoulder,
compulsively, at the window, and then again at the door,
and thought, Is it moving? But I locked it; is it moving?</p>

<p class="pindent">I think, she decided concretely, that I would like this
better if I had the blankets over my head. Hidden deep in
the bed under the blankets, she giggled and was glad none
of the others could hear her. In the city she never slept
with her head under the covers; I have come all this way
today, she thought.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then she slept, secure; in the next room Theodora slept,
smiling, with her light on. Farther down the hall the doctor,
reading <span class="it">Pamela</span>, lifted his head occasionally to listen, and
once went to his door and stood for a minute, looking down
the hall, before going back to his book. A nightlight shone
at the top of the stairs over the pool of blackness which
was the hall. Luke slept, on his bedside table a flashlight
and the lucky piece he always carried with him. Around
them the house brooded, settling and stirring with a movement
that was almost like a shudder.</p>

<p class="pindent">Six miles away Mrs Dudley awakened, looked at her
clock, thought of Hill House, and shut her eyes quickly.
Mrs Gloria Sanderson, who owned Hill House and lived
three hundred miles away from it, closed her detective story,
yawned, and reached up to turn off her light, wondering
briefly if she had remembered to put the chain on the front
door. Theodora’s friend slept; so did the doctor’s wife and
Eleanor’s sister. Far away, in the trees over Hill House, an
owl cried out, and towards morning a thin, fine rain began,
misty and dull.</p>

<h2><a name="chap04"></a>FOUR</h2>

<p class="noindent">Eleanor awakened to find the blue room grey and colourless
in the morning rain. She found that she had thrown the quilt
off during the night and had finished sleeping in her usual
manner, with her head on the pillow. It was a surprise to
find that she had slept until after eight, and she thought
that it was ironic that the first good night’s sleep she had
had in years had come to her in Hill House. Lying in the
blue bed, looking up into the dim ceiling with its remote
carved pattern, she asked herself, half asleep still, What did
I do; did I make a fool of myself? Were they laughing at me?</p>

<p class="pindent">Thinking quickly over the evening before, she could remember
only that she had—must have—seemed foolishly,
childishly contented, almost happy; had the others been
amused to see that she was so simple? I said silly things, she
told herself, and of course they noticed. Today I will be
more reserved, less openly grateful to all of them for having
me.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then, awakening completely, she shook her head and
sighed. You are a very silly baby, Eleanor, she told herself,
as she did every morning.</p>

<p class="pindent">The room came clearly alive around her; she was in the
blue room at Hill House, the dimity curtains were moving
slightly at the window, and the wild splashing in the bathroom
must be Theodora, awake, sure to be dressed and
ready first, certain to be hungry. ‘Good morning,’ Eleanor
called, and Theodora answering, gasping, ‘Good morning—through
in a minute—I’ll leave the tub filled for you—are
you starving? Because I am.’ Does she think I wouldn’t
bathe unless she left a full tub for me? Eleanor wondered,
and then was ashamed; I came here to stop thinking things
like that, she told herself sternly and rolled out of bed and
went to the window. She looked out across the verandah
roof to the wide lawn below, with its bushes and little
clumps of trees wound around with mist. Far down at the
end of the lawn was the line of trees which marked the path
to the creek, although the prospect of a jolly picnic on the
grass was not, this morning, so appealing. It was clearly
going to be wet all day, but it was a summer rain, deepening
the green of the grass and the trees, sweetening and
cleaning the air. It’s charming, Eleanor thought, surprised
at herself; she wondered if she was the first person ever to
find Hill House charming and then thought, chilled, Or do
they <span class="it">all</span> think so, the <span class="it">first</span> morning? She shivered, and found
herself at the same time unable to account for the excitement
she felt, which made it difficult to remember why it
was so odd to wake up happy in Hill House.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll <span class="it">starve</span> to death.’ Theodora pounded on the bathroom
door, and Eleanor snatched at her robe and hurried. ‘Try
to look like a stray sunbeam,’ Theodora called out from her
room. ‘It’s such a dark day we’ve got to be a little brighter
than usual.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sing before breakfast you’ll cry before eight, Eleanor told
herself, because she had been singing softly, ‘In delay there
lies no plenty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I thought <span class="it">I</span> was the lazy one,’ Theodora said complacently
through the door, ‘but you’re much, <span class="it">much</span> worse. Lazy
hardly <span class="it">begins</span> to describe you. You <span class="it">must</span> be clean enough
now to come and have breakfast.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mrs Dudley sets out breakfast at nine. What will she
think when we show up bright and smiling?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She will sob with disappointment. Did anyone scream for
her in the night, do you suppose?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor regarded a soapy leg critically. ‘I slept like a log,’
she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So did I. If you are not ready in three minutes I will
come in and drown you. I want my <span class="it">breakfast</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor was thinking that it had been a very long time
since she had dressed to look like a stray sunbeam, or been
so hungry for breakfast, or arisen so aware, so conscious
of herself, so deliberate and tender in her attentions; she
even brushed her teeth with a niceness she could not remember
ever feeling before. It is all the result of a good
night’s sleep, she thought; since Mother died I must have
been sleeping even more poorly than I realised.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Aren’t you ready <span class="it">yet</span>?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Coming, coming,’ Eleanor said, and ran to the door, remembered
that it was still locked, and unlocked it softly.
Theodora was waiting for her in the hall, vivid in the dullness
in gaudy plaid; looking at Theodora, it was not possible
for Eleanor to believe that she ever dressed or washed or
moved or ate or slept or talked without enjoying every
minute of what she was doing; perhaps Theodora never
cared at all what other people thought of her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Do you realise that we may be another hour or so just
<span class="it">finding</span> the dining-room?’ Theodora said. ‘But maybe they
have left us a map—did you know that Luke and the doctor
have been up for hours? I was talking to them from the
window.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They have started without me, Eleanor thought; tomorrow
I will wake up earlier and be there to talk from
the window too. They came to the foot of the stairs, and
Theodora crossed the great dark hall and put her hand
confidently to a door. ‘Here,’ she said, but the door opened
into a dim, echoing room neither of them had seen before.
‘Here,’ Eleanor said, but the door she chose led on to the
narrow passage to the little parlour where last night they
had sat before a fire.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s across the hall from <span class="it">that</span>,’ Theodora said, and turned,
baffled. ‘<span class="it">Damn</span> it,’ she said, and put her head back and
shouted. ‘Luke? Doctor?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Distantly they heard an answering shout, and Theodora
moved to open another door. ‘If they think,’ she said over
her shoulder, ‘that they are going to keep me for ever in
this filthy hall, trying one door after another to get to my
breakfast——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s the right one, I think,’ Eleanor said, ‘with the dark
room to go through, and then the dining-room beyond.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora shouted again, blundered against some light
piece of furniture, cursed, and then the door beyond was
opened and the doctor said, ‘Good morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Foul, filthy house,’ Theodora said, rubbing her knee.
‘Good morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You will never believe this now, of course,’ the doctor
said, ‘but three minutes ago these doors were wide open.
We left them open so you could find your way. We sat here
and watched them swing shut just before you called. Well.
Good morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Kippers,’ Luke said from the table. ‘Good morning. I hope
you ladies <span class="it">are</span> the kipper kind.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They had come through the darkness of one night, they
had met morning in Hill House, and they were a family,
greeting one another with easy informality and going to
the chairs they had used last night at dinner, their own
places at the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A fine big breakfast is what Mrs Dudley certainly agreed
to set out at nine,’ Luke said, waving a fork. ‘We had begun
to wonder if you were the coffee-and-a-roll-in-bed types.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We would have been here much sooner in any other
house,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Did you really leave all the doors open for us?’ Eleanor
asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s how we knew you were coming,’ Luke told her.
‘We saw the doors swing shut.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Today we will nail all the doors open,’ Theodora said. ‘I
am going to pace this house until I can find food ten times
out of ten. I slept with my light on all night,’ she confided
to the doctor, ‘but nothing happened at all.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was all very quiet,’ the doctor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Did you watch over us all night?’ Eleanor asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Until about three, when <span class="it">Pamela</span> finally put me to sleep.
There wasn’t a sound until the rain started some time after
two. One of you ladies called out in her sleep once——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That must have been me,’ Theodora said shamelessly.
‘Dreaming about the wicked sister at the gates of Hill
House.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I dreamed about her too,’ Eleanor said. She looked at
the doctor and said suddenly, ‘It’s <span class="it">embarrassing</span>. To think
about being afraid, I mean.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’re all in it together, you know,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s worse if you try not to show it,’ the doctor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Stuff yourself very full of kippers,’ Luke said. ‘Then it
will be impossible to feel anything at all.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor felt, as she had the day before, that the conversation
was being skilfully guided away from the thought of
fear, so very present in her own mind. Perhaps she was to
be allowed to speak occasionally for all of them so that,
quieting her, they quieted themselves and could leave the
subject behind them; perhaps, vehicle for every kind of fear,
she contained enough for all. They are like children, she
thought crossly, daring each other to go first, ready to turn
and call names at whoever comes last; she pushed her plate
away from her and sighed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Before I go to sleep <span class="it">tonight</span>,’ Theodora was saying to the
doctor, ‘I want to be sure that I have seen every inch of
this house. No more lying there wondering what is over
my head or under me. And we <span class="it">have</span> to open some windows
and keep the doors open and stop feeling our way
around.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Little signs,’ Luke suggested. ‘Arrows pointing, reading
<span style="font-size:smaller">THIS WAY OUT</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Or <span style="font-size:smaller">DEAD END</span>,’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Or <span style="font-size:smaller">WATCH OUT FOR FALLING FURNITURE</span>,’ Theodora said.
‘<span class="it">We</span>’ll make them,’ she said to Luke.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘First we all explore the house,’ Eleanor said, too quickly
perhaps, because Theodora turned and looked at her
curiously. ‘I don’t want to find myself left behind in an attic
or something,’ Eleanor added uncomfortably.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No one wants to leave you behind anywhere,’ Theodora
said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then <span class="it">I</span> suggest,’ Luke said, ‘that we first of all finish off
the coffee in the pot, and then go nervously from room to
room, endeavouring to discover some rational plan to this
house, and leaving doors open as we go. I never thought,’
he said, shaking his head sadly, ‘that I would stand to inherit
a house where I had to put up signs to find my way
around.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We need to find out what to call the rooms,’ Theodora
said. ‘Suppose I told you, Luke, that I would meet you
clandestinely in the second-best drawing-room—how would
you ever know where to find me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You could keep whistling till I got there,’ Luke
offered.</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora shuddered. ‘You would hear me whistling, and
calling you, while you wandered from door to door, never
opening the right one, and I would be inside, not able to
find any way to get out——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And nothing to eat,’ Eleanor said unkindly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora looked at her again. ‘And nothing to eat,’ she
agreed after a minute. Then, ‘It’s the crazy house at the
carnival,’ she said. ‘Rooms opening out of each other and
doors going everywhere at once and swinging shut when
you come, and I bet that somewhere there are mirrors that
make you look all sideways and an air hose to blow up your
skirts, and something that comes out of a dark passage and
laughs in your face——’ She was suddenly quiet and picked
up her cup so quickly that her coffee spilled.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not as bad as all that,’ the doctor said easily. ‘Actually,
the ground floor is laid out in what I might almost call concentric
circles of rooms; at the centre is the little parlour
where we sat last night; around it, roughly, are a series of
rooms—the billiard room, for instance, and a dismal little
den entirely furnished in rose-coloured satin——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Where Eleanor and I will go each morning with our
needlework.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘—and surrounding these—I call them the inside rooms
because they are the ones with no direct way to the outside;
they have no windows, you remember—surrounding these
are the ring of outside rooms, the drawing-room, the library,
the conservatory, the——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ Theodora said, shaking her head. ‘I am still lost back
in the rose-coloured satin.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And the verandah goes all around the house. There are
doors opening on to the verandah from the drawing-room,
and the conservatory, and one sitting-room. There is also
a passage——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Stop, stop.’ Theodora was laughing, but she shook her
head. ‘It’s a filthy, <span class="it">rotten</span> house.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The swinging door in the corner of the dining-room
opened, and Mrs Dudley stood, one hand holding the door
open, looking without expression at the breakfast table. ‘I
clear off at ten,’ Mrs Dudley said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good morning, Mrs Dudley,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Dudley turned her eyes to him. ‘I clear off at ten,’ she
said. ‘The dishes are supposed to be back on the shelves.
I take them out again for lunch. I set out lunch at one, but
first the dishes have to be back on the shelves.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course, Mrs Dudley.’ The doctor rose and put down
his napkin. ‘Everybody ready?’ he asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">Under Mrs Dudley’s eye Theodora deliberately lifted her
cup and finished the last of her coffee, then touched her
mouth with her napkin and sat back. ‘Splendid breakfast,’
she said conversationally. ‘Do the dishes belong to the
house?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They belong on the shelves,’ Mrs Dudley said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And the glassware and the silver and the linen? Lovely
old things.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The linen,’ Mrs Dudley said, ‘belongs in the linen drawers
in the dining-room. The silver belongs in the silver chest.
The glasses belong on the shelves.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We must be quite a bother to you,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Dudley was silent. Finally she said, ‘I clear up at ten.
I set out lunch at one.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora laughed and rose. ‘On,’ she said, ‘on, on. Let
us go and open doors.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They began reasonably enough with the dining-room
door, which they propped open with a heavy chair. The
room beyond was the game room; the table against which
Theodora had stumbled was a low inlaid chess table (‘Now,
I could not have overlooked that last night,’ the doctor said
irritably), and at one end of the room were card tables and
chairs, and a tall cabinet where the chessmen had been,
with croquet balls and the cribbage board.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Jolly spot to spend a carefree hour,’ Luke said, standing
in the doorway regarding the bleak room. The cold greens
of the table tops were reflected unhappily in the dark tiles
around the fireplace; the inevitable wood panelling was,
here, not at all enlivened by a series of sporting prints
which seemed entirely devoted to various methods of doing
wild animals to death, and over the mantel a deerhead
looked down upon them in patent embarrassment.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This is where they came to enjoy themselves,’ Theodora
said, and her voice echoed shakily from the high ceiling.
‘They came here,’ she explained, ‘to relax from the oppressive
atmosphere of the rest of the house.’ The deerhead
looked down on her mournfully. ‘Those two little girls,’ she
said. ‘Can we <span class="it">please</span> take down that <span class="it">beast</span> up there?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think it’s taken a fancy to you,’ Luke said. ‘It’s never
taken its eyes off you since you came in. Let’s get out of
here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They propped the door open as they left, and came out
into the hall, which shone dully under the light from the
open rooms. ‘When we find a room with a window,’ the
doctor remarked, ‘we will open it; until then, let us be
content with opening the front door.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You keep thinking of the little children,’ Eleanor said to
Theodora, ‘but I can’t forget that lonely little companion,
walking around these rooms, wondering who else was in the
house.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Luke tugged the great front door open and wheeled the
big vase to hold it; ‘Fresh air,’ he said thankfully. The warm
smell of rain and wet grass swept into the hall, and for a
minute they stood in the open doorway, breathing air from
outside Hill House. Then the doctor said, ‘Now <span class="it">here</span> is something
none of you anticipated,’ and he opened a small door
tucked in beside the tall front door and stood back, smiling.
‘The library,’ he said. ‘In the tower.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I can’t go in there,’ Eleanor said, surprising herself, but
she could not. She backed away, overwhelmed with the cold
air of mould and earth which rushed at her. ‘My mother——’
she said, not knowing what she wanted to tell them, and
pressed herself against the wall.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Indeed?’ said the doctor, regarding her with interest.
‘Theodora?’ Theodora shrugged and stepped into the
library; Eleanor shivered. ‘Luke?’ said the doctor, but Luke
was already inside. From where she stood Eleanor could see
only a part of the circular wall of the library, with a narrow
iron staircase going up and perhaps, since it was the tower,
up and up and up; Eleanor shut her eyes, hearing the
doctor’s voice distantly, hollow against the stone of the
library walls.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Can you see the little trapdoor up there in the shadows?’
he was asking. ‘It leads out on to a little balcony, and of
course that’s where she is commonly supposed to have
hanged herself—the girl, you remember. A most suitable
spot, certainly; more suitable for suicides, I would think,
than for books. She is supposed to have tied the rope on to
the iron railing and then just stepped——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thanks,’ Theodora said from within. ‘I can visualise it
perfectly, thank you. For myself, I would probably have
anchored the rope on to the deerhead in the game room,
but I suppose she had some sentimental attachment to the
tower; what a nice word “attachment” is in that context,
don’t you think?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Delicious.’ It was Luke’s voice, louder; they were coming
out of the library and back to the hall where Eleanor waited.
‘I think that I will make this room into a night club. I will
put the orchestra up there on the balcony, and dancing girls
will come down that winding iron staircase; the bar——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor,’ Theodora said, ‘are you all right now? It’s a
perfectly awful room, and you were right to stay out of it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor stood away from the wall; her hands were cold
and she wanted to cry, but she turned her back to the library
door, which the doctor propped open with a stack of books.
‘I don’t think I’ll do much reading while I’m here,’ she said,
trying to speak lightly. ‘Not if the books smell like the
library.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hadn’t noticed a smell,’ the doctor said. He looked inquiringly
at Luke, who shook his head. ‘Odd,’ the doctor
went on, ‘and just the kind of thing we’re looking for. Make
a note of it, my dear, and try to describe it exactly.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora was puzzled. She stood in the hallway, turning,
looking behind her at the staircase and then around again
at the front door. ‘Are there two front doors?’ she asked. ‘Am
I just mixed up?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor smiled happily; he had clearly been hoping
for some such question. ‘This is the only front door,’ he
said. ‘It is the one you came in yesterday.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora frowned. ‘Then why can’t Eleanor and I see
the tower from our bedroom windows? Our rooms look out
over the front of the house, and yet——’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor laughed and clapped his hands. ‘At last,’ he
said. ‘Clever Theodora. This is why I wanted you to see
the house by day. Come, sit on the stairs while I tell you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Obediently they settled on the stairs, looking up at the
doctor, who took on his lecturing stance and began formally,
‘One of the peculiar traits of Hill House is its design——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Crazy house at the carnival.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Precisely. Have you not wondered at our <span class="it">extreme</span> difficulty
in finding our way around? An ordinary house would
not have had the four of us in such confusion for so long,
and yet time after time we choose the wrong doors, the
room we want eludes us. Even I have had my troubles.’ He
sighed and nodded. ‘I dare say,’ he went on, ‘that old Hugh
Crain expected that some day Hill House might become a
showplace, like the Winchester House in California or the
many octagon houses; he designed Hill House himself,
remember, and, I have told you before, he was a strange
man. Every angle’—and the doctor gestured towards the
doorway—‘every angle is slightly wrong. Hugh Crain must
have detested other people and their sensible squared-away
houses, because he made his house to suit his mind. Angles
which you assume are the right angles you are accustomed
to, and have every right to expect are true, are actually a
fraction of a degree off in one direction or another. I am
sure, for instance, that you believe that the stairs you are
sitting on are level, because you are not prepared for stairs
which are not level——’</p>

<p class="pindent">They moved uneasily, and Theodora put out a quick hand
to take hold of the balustrade, as though she felt she might
be falling.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘—are actually on a very slight slant towards the central
shaft; the doorways are all a very little bit off centre—that
may be, by the way, the reason the doors swing shut unless
they are held; I wondered this morning whether the
approaching footsteps of you two ladies upset the delicate
balance of the doors. Of course the result of all these tiny
aberrations of measurement adds up to a fairly large distortion
in the house as a whole. Theodora cannot see the tower
from her bedroom window because the tower actually stands
at the corner of the house. From Theodora’s bedroom
window it is completely invisible, although from here it
seems to be directly outside her room. The window of
Theodora’s room is actually fifteen feet to the left of where
we are now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora spread her hands helplessly. ‘Golly,’ she
said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I see,’ Eleanor said. ‘The verandah roof is what misleads
us. I can look out my window and see the verandah roof
and because I came directly into the house and up the stairs
I assumed that the front door was right below, although
really——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You see only the verandah roof,’ the doctor said. ‘The
front door is far away; it and the tower are visible from
the nursery, which is the big room at the end of the hallway;
we will see it later today. It is’—and his voice was saddened—‘a
masterpiece of architectural misdirection. The
double stairway at Chambord——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then everything is a little bit off centre?’ Theodora asked
uncertainly. ‘That’s why it all feels so disjointed?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What happens when you go back to a real house?’
Eleanor asked. ‘I mean—a—well—a <span class="it">real</span> house?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It must be like coming off shipboard,’ Luke said. ‘After
being here for a while your sense of balance could be so
distorted that it would take you a while to lose your sea
legs, or your Hill House legs. Could it be,’ he asked the
doctor, ‘that what people have been assuming were supernatural
manifestations were really only the result of a slight
loss of balance in the people who live here? The inner ear,’
he told Theodora wisely.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It must certainly affect people in some way,’ the doctor
said. ‘We have grown to trust blindly in our senses of
balance and reason, and I can see where the mind might
fight wildly to preserve its own familiar stable patterns
against all evidence that it was leaning sideways.’ He
turned away. ‘We have marvels still before us,’ he said, and
they came down from the stairway and followed him, walking
gingerly, testing the floors as they moved. They went
down the narrow passage to the little parlour where they
had sat the night before, and from there, leaving doors
propped open behind them, they moved into the outer circle
of rooms, which looked out on to the verandah. They pulled
heavy draperies away from windows and the light from
outside came into Hill House. They passed through a music
room where a harp stood sternly apart from them, with
never a jangle of strings to mark their footfalls. A grand
piano stood tightly shut, with a candelabra above, no candle
ever touched by flame. A marble-topped table held wax
flowers under glass, and the chairs were twig-thin and
gilded. Beyond this was the conservatory, with tall glass
doors showing them the rain outside, and ferns growing
damply around and over wicker furniture. Here it was uncomfortably
moist, and they left it quickly, to come through
an arched doorway into the drawing-room and stand, aghast
and incredulous.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s not there,’ Theodora said, weak and laughing. ‘I don’t
believe it’s there.’ She shook her head. ‘Eleanor, do you see
it too?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?’ Eleanor said helplessly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I thought you would be pleased.’ The doctor was complacent.</p>

<p class="pindent">One entire end of the drawing-room was in possession
of a marble statuary piece; against the mauve stripes and
flowered carpet it was huge and grotesque and somehow
whitely naked; Eleanor put her hands over her eyes, and
Theodora clung to her. ‘I thought it might be intended for
Venus rising from the waves,’ the doctor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not at all,’ said Luke, finding his voice, ‘it’s Saint Francis
curing the lepers.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, no,’ Eleanor said. ‘One of them is a dragon.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s none of that,’ said Theodora roundly; ‘it’s a family
portrait, you sillies. Composite. <span class="it">Anyone</span> would know it at
once; that figure in the centre, that tall, undraped—good
heavens!—masculine one, that’s old Hugh, patting himself
on the back because he built Hill House, and his two attendant
nymphs are his daughters. The one on the right who
seems to be brandishing an ear of corn is actually telling
about her lawsuit, and the other one, the little one on the
end, is the companion, and the one on the <span class="it">other</span> end——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is Mrs Dudley, done from life,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And that grass stuff they’re all standing on is really supposed
to be the dining-room carpet, grown up a little. Did
anyone else notice that dining-room carpet? It looks like a
field of hay, and you can feel it tickling your ankles. In the
background, that kind of overspreading apple-tree kind of
thing, <span class="it">that’s</span>——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A symbol of the protection of the house, surely,’ Dr
Montague said.</p>

<p class="pindent">I’d hate to think it might fall on us,’ Eleanor said. ‘Since
the house is so unbalanced, Doctor, isn’t there some chance
of that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have read that the statue was carefully, and at great
expense, constructed to offset the uncertainty of the floor
on which it stands. It was put in, at any rate, when the
house was built, and it has not fallen yet. It is possible, you
know, that Hugh Crain admired it, even found it lovely.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It is also possible that he used it to scare his children
with,’ Theodora said. ‘What a pretty room this would be
without it.’ She turned, swinging. ‘A dancing room,’ she said,
‘for ladies in full skirts, and room enough for a full country
dance. Hugh Crain, will you take a turn with me?’ and
she curtsied to the statue.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I believe he’s going to accept,’ Eleanor said, taking an
involuntary step backward.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t let him tread on your toes,’ the doctor said, and
laughed. ‘Remember what happened to Don Juan.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora touched the statue timidly, putting her finger
against the outstretched hand of one of the figures. ‘Marble
is always a shock,’ she said. ‘It never feels like you think it’s
going to. I suppose a lifesize statue looks enough like a real
person to make you expect to feel skin.’ Then, turning again,
and shimmering in the dim room, she waltzed alone, turning
to bow to the statue.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘At the end of the room,’ the doctor said to Eleanor and
Luke, ‘under those draperies, are doors leading on to the
verandah; when Theodora is heated from dancing she may
step into the cooler air.’ He went the length of the room
to pull aside the heavy blue draperies and opened the doors.
Again the smell of the warm rain came in, and a burst of
wind, so that a little breath seemed to move across the
statue, and light touched the coloured walls.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nothing in this house moves,’ Eleanor said, ‘until you
look away, and then you just catch something from the
corner of your eye. Look at the little figurines on the shelves;
when we all had our backs turned they were dancing with
Theodora.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">I</span> move,’ Theodora said, circling towards them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Flowers under glass,’ Luke said. ‘Tassels. I am beginning
to fancy this house.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora pulled at Eleanor’s hair. ‘Race you around the
verandah,’ she said and darted for the doors. Eleanor, with
no time for hesitation or thought, followed, and they ran
out on to the verandah. Eleanor, running and laughing,
came around a curve of the verandah to find Theodora going
in through another door, and stopped, breathless. They had
come to the kitchen, and Mrs Dudley, turning away from
the sink, watched them silently.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mrs Dudley,’ Theodora said politely, ‘we’ve been exploring
the house.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Dudley’s eyes moved to the clock on the shelf over
the stove. ‘It is half-past eleven,’ she said. ‘I——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘—set lunch on at one,’ Theodora said. ‘We’d like to look
over the kitchen, if we may. We’ve seen all the other downstairs
rooms, I think.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Dudley was still for a minute and then, moving her
head acquiescently, turned and walked deliberately across
the kitchen to a farther doorway. When she opened it they
could see the back stairs beyond, and Mrs Dudley turned
and closed the door behind her before she started up.
Theodora cocked her head at the doorway and waited a
minute before she said, ‘I wonder if Mrs Dudley has a soft
spot in her heart for me, I really do.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I suppose she’s gone up to hang herself from the turret,’
Eleanor said. ‘Let’s see what’s for lunch while we’re here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t joggle anything,’ Theodora said. ‘You know perfectly
well that the dishes belong on the shelves. Do you
think that woman really means to make us a soufflé? Here
is certainly a soufflé dish, and eggs and cheese——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s a nice kitchen,’ Eleanor said. ‘In my mother’s house
the kitchen was dark and narrow, and nothing you cooked
there ever had any taste or colour.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What about your own kitchen?’ Theodora asked absently.
‘In your little apartment? Eleanor, look at the doors.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I can’t make a soufflé,’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Look, Eleanor. There’s the door on to the verandah, and
another that opens on to steps going down;—to the cellar,
I guess—and another over there going on to the verandah
again, and the one she used to go upstairs, and another one
over there——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘To the verandah again,’ Eleanor said, opening it. ‘Three
doors going out on to the verandah from one kitchen.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And the door to the butler’s pantry and on into the dining-room.
Our good Mrs Dudley likes doors, doesn’t she? She
can certainly’—and their eyes met—‘get out fast in any
direction if she wants to.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor turned abruptly and went back to the verandah.
‘I wonder if she had Dudley cut extra doors for her. I wonder
how she likes working in a kitchen where a door behind
her might open without her knowing it. I wonder, actually,
just what Mrs Dudley is in the habit of meeting in her
kitchen so that she wants to make sure that she’ll find a way
out no matter which direction she runs. I wonder——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Shut up,’ Theodora said amiably. ‘A nervous cook can’t
make a good soufflé, anyone knows that, and she’s probably
listening on the stairs. Let us choose one of her doors and
leave it open behind us.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Luke and the doctor were standing on the verandah,
looking out over the lawn; the front door was oddly close,
beyond them. Behind the house, seeming almost overhead,
the great hills were muted and dull in the rain. Eleanor
wandered along the verandah, thinking that she had never
before known a house so completely surrounded. Like a
very tight belt, she thought; would the house fly apart if
the verandah came off? She went what she thought must
be the greater part of the circle around the house, and then
she saw the tower. It rose up before her suddenly, almost
without warning, as she came around the curve of the
verandah. It was made of grey stone, grotesquely solid,
jammed hard against the wooden side of the house, with
the insistent verandah holding it there. Hideous, she
thought, and then thought that if the house burned away
some day the tower would still stand, grey and forbidding
over the ruins, warning people away from what was left of
Hill House, with perhaps a stone fallen here and there, so
owls and bats might fly in and out and nest among the
books below. Half-way up windows began, thin angled slits
in the stone, and she wondered what it would be like, looking
down from them, and wondered that she had not been
able to enter the tower. I will never look down from those
windows, she thought, and tried to imagine the narrow iron
stairway going up and around inside. High on top was a
conical wooden roof, topped by a wooden spire. It must
have been laughable in any other house, but here in Hill
House it belonged, gleeful and expectant, awaiting perhaps
a slight creature creeping out from the little window on to
the slanted roof, reaching up to the spire, knotting a
rope.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’ll fall,’ Luke said, and Eleanor gasped; she brought
her eyes down with an effort and found that she was gripping
the verandah rail tightly and leaning far backward.
‘Don’t trust your balance in my charming Hill House,’ Luke
said, and Eleanor breathed deeply, dizzy, and staggered.
He caught her and held her while she tried to steady herself
in the rocking world where the trees and the lawn seemed
somehow tilted sideways and the sky turned and swung.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor?’ Theodora said near by, and she heard the
sound of the doctor’s feet running along the verandah. ‘This
damnable house,’ Luke said. ‘You have to watch it every
minute.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor?’ said the doctor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m all right,’ Eleanor said, shaking her head and standing
unsteadily by herself. ‘I was leaning back to see the
top of the tower and I got dizzy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She was standing almost sideways when I caught her,’
Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve had that feeling once or twice this morning,’ Theodora
said, ‘as though I was walking up the wall.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bring her back inside,’ the doctor said. ‘It’s not so bad
when you’re <span class="it">inside</span> the house.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m really all right,’ Eleanor said, very much embarrassed,
and she walked with deliberate steps along the verandah
to the front door, which was closed. ‘I thought we left it
open,’ she said with a little shake in her voice, and the
doctor came past her and pushed the heavy door open again.
Inside, the hall had returned to itself; all the doors they
had left open were neatly closed. When the doctor opened
the door into the game room they could see beyond him
that the doors to the dining-room were closed, and the little
stool they had used to prop one door open was neatly back
in its place against the wall. In the boudoir and the drawing-room,
the parlour and the conservatory, the doors and
windows were closed, the draperies pulled together, and
the darkness back again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s Mrs Dudley,’ Theodora said, trailing after the doctor
and Luke, who moved quickly from one room to the next,
pushing doors wide open again and propping them, sweeping
drapes away from windows and letting in the warm,
wet air. ‘Mrs Dudley did it yesterday, as soon as Eleanor
and I were out of the way, because she’d rather shut them
herself than come along and find them shut by themselves
because the doors belong shut and the windows belong
shut and the dishes belong——’ She began to laugh
foolishly, and the doctor turned and frowned at her with
irritation.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mrs Dudley had better learn her place,’ he said. ‘I will
nail these doors open if I have to.’ He turned down the
passageway to their little parlour and sent the door swinging
open with a crash. ‘Losing my temper will not help,’ he
said, and gave the door a vicious kick.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sherry in the parlour before lunch,’ Luke said amiably.
‘Ladies, enter.’</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘Mrs Dudley,’ the doctor said, putting down his fork, ‘an
admirable soufflé.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Dudley turned to regard him briefly and went into
the kitchen with an empty dish.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor sighed and moved his shoulders tiredly. ‘After
my vigil last night, I feel the need for a rest this afternoon,
and you,’ he said to Eleanor, ‘would do well to lie down
for an hour. Perhaps a regular afternoon rest might be more
comfortable for all of us.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I see,’ said Theodora, amused. ‘I must take an afternoon
nap. It may look funny when I go home again, but I can
always tell them that it was part of my schedule at Hill
House.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps we will have trouble sleeping at night,’ the
doctor said, and a little chill went around the table, darkening
the light of the silver and the bright colours of the china,
a little cloud that drifted through the dining-room and
brought Mrs Dudley after it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s five minutes to two,’ Mrs Dudley said.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor did not sleep during the afternoon, although she
would have liked to; instead, she lay on Theodora’s bed in
the green room and watched Theodora do her nails, chatting
lazily, unwilling to let herself perceive that she had
followed Theodora into the green room because she had not
dared to be alone.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I love decorating myself,’ Theodora said, regarding her
hand affectionately. ‘I’d like to paint myself all over.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor moved comfortably. ‘Gold paint,’ she suggested,
hardly thinking. With her eyes almost closed she could see
Theodora only as a mass of colour sitting on the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nail polish and perfume and bath salts,’ Theodora said,
as one telling the cities of the Nile. ‘Mascara. You don’t
think half enough of such things, Eleanor.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor laughed and closed her eyes altogether. ‘No time,’
she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well,’ Theodora said with determination, ‘by the time I’m
through with you, you will be a different person; I dislike
being with women of no colour.’ She laughed to show that
she was teasing, and then went on, ‘I think I will put red
polish on your toes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor laughed too and held out her bare foot. After a
minute, nearly asleep, she felt the odd cold little touch of
the brush on her toes, and shivered.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Surely a famous courtesan like yourself is accustomed
to the ministrations of handmaidens,’ Theodora said. ‘Your
feet are dirty.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Shocked, Eleanor sat up and looked; her feet <span class="it">were</span> dirty,
and her nails were painted bright red. ‘It’s <span class="it">horrible</span>,’ she said
to Theodora, ‘it’s <span class="it">wicked</span>,’ wanting to cry. Then, helplessly,
she began to laugh at the look on Theodora’s face. ‘I’ll go
and wash my feet,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Golly.’ Theodora sat on the floor beside the bed, staring.
‘Look,’ she said. ‘My feet are dirty, too, baby, honest. <span class="it">Look.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Anyway,’ Eleanor said, ‘I hate having things done to me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re about as crazy as anyone <span class="it">I</span> ever saw,’ Theodora
said cheerfully.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t like to feel helpless,’ Eleanor said. ‘My mother——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Your mother would have been delighted to see you with
your toe-nails painted red,’ Theodora said. ‘They look nice.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor looked at her feet again. ‘It’s wicked,’ she said
inadequately. ‘I mean—on <span class="it">my</span> feet. It makes me feel like
I look like a fool.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’ve got foolishness and wickedness somehow mixed
up.’ Theodora began to gather her equipment together.
‘Anyway, I won’t take it off and we’ll both watch to see
whether Luke and the doctor look at your feet first.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No matter what I try to say, you make it sound foolish,’
Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Or wicked.’ Theodora looked up at her gravely. ‘I have a
hunch,’ she said, ‘that you ought to go home, Eleanor.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Is she laughing at me? Eleanor wondered; has she decided
that I am not fit to stay? ‘I don’t want to go,’ she said, and
Theodora looked at her again quickly and then away, and
touched Eleanor’s toes softly. ‘The polish is dry,’ she said.
‘I’m an idiot. Just something frightened me for a minute.’
She stood up and stretched. ‘Let’s go and look for the others,’
she said.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class="pindent">Luke leaned himself wearily against the wall of the upstairs
hall, his head resting against the gold frame of an
engraving of a ruin. ‘I keep thinking of this house as my
own future property,’ he said, ‘more now than I did before;
I keep telling myself that it will belong to me some day, and
I keep asking myself why.’ He gestured at the length of
the hall. ‘If I had a passion for doors,’ he said, ‘or gilded
clocks, or miniatures; if I wanted a Turkish corner of my
own, I would very likely regard Hill House as a fairyland
of beauty.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s a handsome house,’ the doctor said staunchly. ‘It must
have been thought of as elegant when it was built.’ He
started off down the hall, to the large room on the end
which had once been the nursery. ‘Now,’ he said, ‘we shall
see the tower from a window’—and shivered as he passed
through the door. Then he turned and looked back curiously.
‘Could there be a draught across that doorway?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A draught? In Hill House?’ Theodora laughed. ‘Not unless
you could manage to make one of those doors stay
open.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Come here one at a time, then,’ the doctor said, and
Theodora moved forward, grimacing as she passed the
doorway.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Like the doorway of a tomb,’ she said. ‘It’s warm enough
inside, though.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Luke came, hesitated in the cold spot, and then moved
quickly to get out of it, and Eleanor, following, felt with
incredulity the piercing cold that struck her between one
step and the next; it was like passing through a wall of ice,
she thought, and asked the doctor, ‘What is it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor was patting his hands together with delight.
‘You can keep your Turkish corners, my boy,’ he said. He
reached out a hand and held it carefully over the location
of the cold. ‘They <span class="it">cannot</span> explain this,’ he said. ‘The very
essence of the tomb, as Theodora points out. The cold spot
in Borley Rectory only dropped eleven degrees,’ he went on
complacently. ‘This, I should think, is considerably colder.
The heart of the house.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora and Eleanor had moved to stand closer together;
although the nursery was warm, it smelled musty
and close, and the cold crossing the doorway was almost
tangible, visible as a barrier which must be crossed in order
to get out. Beyond the windows the grey stone of the tower
pressed close; inside, the room was dark and the line of
nursery animals painted along the wall seemed somehow
not at all jolly, but as though they were trapped, or related
to the dying deer in the sporting prints of the game room.
The nursery, larger than the other bedrooms, had an indefinable
air of neglect found nowhere else in Hill House,
and it crossed Eleanor’s mind that even Mrs Dudley’s
diligent care might not bring her across that cold barrier
any oftener than necessary.</p>

<p class="pindent">Luke had stepped back across the cold spot and was
examining the hall carpet, then the walls, patting at the
surfaces as though hoping to discover some cause for the
odd cold. ‘It <span class="it">couldn’t</span> be a draught,’ he said, looking up at
the doctor. ‘Unless they’ve got a direct air line to the North
Pole. Everything’s solid, anyway.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I wonder who slept in the nursery,’ the doctor said
irrelevantly. ‘Do you suppose they shut it up, once the
children were gone?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Look,’ Luke said, pointing. In either corner of the hall,
over the nursery doorway, two grinning heads were set;
meant, apparently, as gay decorations for the nursery entrance,
they were no more jolly or carefree than the animals
inside. Their separate stares, captured for ever in distorted
laughter, met and locked at the point of the hall where the
vicious cold centred. ‘When you stand where they can look
at you,’ Luke explained, ‘they freeze you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Curiously, the doctor stepped down the hall to join him,
looking up. ‘Don’t leave us alone in here,’ Theodora said,
and ran out of the nursery, pulling Eleanor through the
cold, which was like a fast slap, or a close cold breath. ‘A
fine place to chill our beer,’ she said, and put out her tongue
at the grinning faces.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I must make a full account of this,’ the doctor said
happily.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It doesn’t seem like an <span class="it">impartial</span> cold,’ Eleanor said, awkward
because she was not quite sure what she meant. ‘I felt
it as <span class="it">deliberate</span>, as though something wanted to give me an
unpleasant shock.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s because of the faces, I suppose,’ the doctor said; he
was on his hands and knees, feeling along the floor. ‘Measuring
tape and thermometer,’ he told himself, ‘chalk for an
outline; perhaps the cold intensifies at night? Everything is
worse,’ he said, looking at Eleanor, ‘if you think something
is looking at you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Luke stepped through the cold, with a shiver, and closed
the door to the nursery; he came back to the others in the
hall with a kind of leap, as though he thought he could
escape the cold by not touching the floor. With the nursery
door closed they realised all at once how much darker it
had become, and Theodora said restlessly, ‘Let’s get downstairs
to our parlour; I can feel those hills pushing in.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘After five,’ Luke said. ‘Cocktail time. I suppose,’ he said
to the doctor, ‘you will trust me to mix you a cocktail again
tonight?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Too much vermouth,’ the doctor said, and followed them
lingeringly, watching the nursery door over his shoulder.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘I propose,’ the doctor said, setting down his napkin, ‘that
we take our coffee in our little parlour. I find that fire very
cheerful.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora giggled. ‘Mrs Dudley’s gone, so let’s race around
fast and get all those doors and windows open and take
everything down from the shelves——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The house seems different when she’s not in it,’ Eleanor
said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Emptier.’ Luke looked at her and nodded; he was arranging
the coffee cups on a tray, and the doctor had already
gone on, doggedly opening doors and propping them. ‘Each
night I realise suddenly that we four are alone here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Although Mrs Dudley’s not much good as far as company
is concerned; it’s funny,’ Eleanor said, looking down at the
dinner-table, ‘I dislike Mrs Dudley as much as any of you,
but my mother would <span class="it">never</span> let me get up and leave a table
looking like this until morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If she wants to leave before dark she has to clear away
in the morning,’ Theodora said without interest. ‘<span class="it">I</span>’m certainly
not going to do it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s not nice to walk away and leave a dirty table.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You couldn’t get them back on the right shelves anyway,
and she’d have to do it all over again just to get your fingermarks
off things.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If I just took the silverware and let it soak——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ Theodora said, catching her hand. ‘Do you want to
go out into that kitchen all alone, with all those doors?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ Eleanor said, setting down the handful of forks she
had gathered. ‘I guess I don’t, really.’ She lingered to look
uneasily at the table, at the crumpled napkins and the drop
of wine spilled by Luke’s place, and shook her head. ‘I don’t
know what my mother would say, though.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Come on,’ Theodora said. ‘They’ve left lights for us.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The fire in the little parlour was bright, and Theodora sat
down beside the coffee tray while Luke brought brandy
from the cupboard where he had carefully set it away the
night before. ‘We must be cheerful at all costs,’ he said. ‘I’ll
challenge you again tonight, Doctor.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Before dinner they had ransacked the other downstairs
rooms for comfortable chairs and lamps, and now their little
parlour was easily the pleasantest room in the house. ‘Hill
House has really been very kind to us,’ Theodora said, giving
Eleanor her coffee, and Eleanor sat down gratefully in a
pillowy, overstuffed chair. ‘No dirty dishes for Eleanor to
wash, a pleasant evening in good company, and perhaps
the sun shining again tomorrow.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We must plan our picnic,’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am going to get fat and lazy in Hill House,’ Theodora
went on. Her insistence on naming Hill House troubled
Eleanor. It’s as though she were saying it deliberately,
Eleanor thought, telling the house she knows its name, calling
the house to tell it where we are; is it bravado? ‘Hill
House, Hill House, Hill House,’ Theodora said softly, and
smiled across at Eleanor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tell me,’ Luke said politely to Theodora, ‘since you are a
princess, tell me about the political situation in your
country.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Very unsettled,’ Theodora said. ‘I ran away because my
father, who is of course the king, insists that I marry Black
Michael, who is the pretender to the throne. I, of course,
cannot endure the sight of Black Michael, who wears one
gold ear-ring and beats his grooms with a riding crop.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A most unstable country,’ Luke said. ‘How did you ever
manage to get away?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I fled in a hay wagon, disguised as a milkmaid. They
never thought to look for me there, and I crossed the border
with papers I forged myself in a woodcutter’s hut.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And Black Michael will no doubt take over the country
now in a <span class="it">coup d’état</span>?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Undoubtedly. And he can have it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It’s like waiting in a dentist’s office, Eleanor thought,
watching them over her coffee cup; waiting in a dentist’s
office and listening while other patients make brave jokes
across the room, all of you certain to meet the dentist sooner
or later. She looked up suddenly, aware of the doctor near
her, and smiled uncertainly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nervous?’ the doctor asked, and Eleanor nodded.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Only because I wonder what’s going to happen,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So do I.’ The doctor moved a chair and sat down beside
her. ‘You have the feeling that something—whatever it is—is
going to happen soon?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes. Everything seems to be waiting.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And <span class="it">they</span>’—the doctor nodded at Theodora and Luke,
who were laughing at each other—‘<span class="it">they</span> meet it in <span class="it">their</span> way;
I wonder what it will do to all of us. I would have said a
month ago that a situation like this would never really come
about, that we four would sit here together, in this house.’
<span class="it">He</span> does not name it, Eleanor noticed. ‘I’ve been waiting
for a long time,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You think we are right to stay?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Right?’ he said. ‘I think we are all incredibly silly to stay.
I think that an atmosphere like this one can find out the
flaws and faults and weaknesses in all of us, and break us
apart in a matter of days. We have only one defence, and
that is running away. At least it can’t <span class="it">follow</span> us, can it? When
we feel ourselves endangered we can leave, just as we came.
And,’ he added dryly, ‘just as fast as we can go.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But we are forewarned,’ Eleanor said, ‘and there are four
of us together.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have already mentioned this to Luke and Theodora,’
he said. ‘Promise me absolutely that you will leave, as fast
as you can, if you begin to feel the house catching at you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I promise,’ Eleanor said, smiling. He is trying to make
me feel braver, she thought, and was grateful. ‘It’s all right,
though,’ she told him. ‘Really, it’s all right.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I will feel no hesitation about sending you away,’ he said,
rising, ‘if it seems to be necessary. Luke?’ he said. ‘Will the
ladies excuse us?’</p>

<p class="pindent">While they set up the chessboard and men Theodora
wandered, cup in hand, around the room, and Eleanor
thought, She moves like an animal, nervous and alert; she
can’t sit still while there is any scent of disturbance in the
air; we are all uneasy. ‘Come and sit by me,’ she said, and
Theodora came, moving with grace, circling to a resting
spot. She sat down in the chair the doctor had left, and
leaned her head back tiredly; how lovely she is, Eleanor
thought, how thoughtlessly, luckily lovely. ‘Are you tired?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora turned her head, smiling. ‘I can’t stand waiting
much longer.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I was just thinking how relaxed you looked.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And <span class="it">I</span> was just thinking of—when was it? day before
yesterday?—and wondering how I could have brought myself
to leave there and come here. Possibly I’m homesick.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Already?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Did you ever think about being homesick? If your home
was Hill House would you be homesick for it? Did those
two little girls cry for their dark, grim house when they
were taken away?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve never been away from anywhere,’ Eleanor said carefully,
‘so I suppose I’ve never been homesick.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How about now? Your little apartment?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps,’ Eleanor said, looking into the fire, ‘I haven’t
had it long enough to believe it’s my own.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I want my own bed,’ Theodora said, and Eleanor thought,
She is sulking again; when she is hungry or tired or bored
she turns into a baby. ‘I’m sleepy,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s after eleven,’ Eleanor said, and as she turned to glance
at the chess game the doctor shouted with joyful triumph,
and Luke laughed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now, sir,’ the doctor said. ‘<span class="it">Now</span>, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fairly beaten, I admit,’ Luke said. He began to gather
the chessmen and set them back into their box. ‘Any reason
why I can’t take a drop of brandy upstairs with me? To put
myself to sleep, or give myself Dutch courage, or some such
reason. Actually’—and he smiled over at Theodora and
Eleanor—‘I plan to stay up and read for a while.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Are you still reading <span class="it">Pamela?</span>’ Eleanor asked the doctor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Volume two. I have three volumes to go, and then I shall
begin <span class="it">Clarissa Harlowe</span>, I think. Perhaps Luke would care
to borrow——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, thanks,’ Luke said hastily. ‘I have a suitcase full of
mystery stories.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor turned to look around. ‘Let me see,’ he said,
‘fire screened, lights out. Leave the doors for Mrs Dudley
to close in the morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiredly, following one another, they went up the great
stairway, turning out lights behind them. ‘Has everyone got
a flashlight, by the way?’ the doctor asked, and they nodded,
more intent upon sleep than the waves of darkness which
came after them up the stairs of Hill House.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good night, everyone,’ Eleanor said, opening the door to
the blue room.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good night,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good night,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good night,’ the doctor said. ‘Sleep tight.’</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘Coming, Mother, coming,’ Eleanor said, fumbling for the
light. ‘It’s all right, I’m coming.’ <span class="it">Eleanor</span>, she heard, <span class="it">Eleanor</span>.
‘Coming, coming,’ she shouted irritably, ‘just a <span class="it">minute</span>, I’m
<span class="it">coming</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Then she thought, with a crashing shock which brought
her awake, cold and shivering, out of bed and awake: <span class="it">I am
in Hill House</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What?’ she cried out. ‘What? Theodora?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor? In here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Coming.’ No time for the light; she kicked a table out
of the way, wondering at the noise of it, and struggled
briefly with the door of the connecting bathroom. That is
not the table falling, she thought; my mother is knocking
on the wall. It was blessedly light in Theodora’s room, and
Theodora was sitting up in bed, her hair tangled from sleep
and her eyes wide with the shock of awakening; I must look
the same way, Eleanor thought, and said, ‘I’m here, what
<span class="it">is</span> it?’—and then heard, clearly for the first time, although
she had been hearing it ever since she awakened. ‘What <span class="it">is</span>
it?’ she whispered.</p>

<p class="pindent">She sat down slowly on the foot of Theodora’s bed,
wondering at what seemed calmness in herself. Now, she
thought, now. It is only a noise, and terribly cold, terribly,
terribly cold. It is a noise down the hall, far down at the
end, near the nursery door, and terribly cold, <span class="it">not</span> my mother
knocking on the wall.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Something is knocking on the doors,’ Theodora said in
a tone of pure rationality.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s all. And it’s down near the other end of the hall.
Luke and the doctor are probably there already, to see what
is going on.’ Not at all like my mother knocking on the wall;
I was dreaming again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bang bang,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bang,’ Eleanor said, and giggled. I am calm, she thought,
but so very cold; the noise is only a kind of banging on the
doors, one after another; is this what I was so afraid about?
‘Bang’ is the best word for it; it sounds like something
children do, not mothers knocking against the wall for help,
and anyway Luke and the doctor are there; is this what they
mean by cold chills going up and down your back? Because
it is not pleasant; it starts in your stomach and goes in waves
around and up and down again like something alive. Like
something alive. Yes. Like something alive.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Theodora,’ she said, and closed her eyes and tightened
her teeth together and wrapped her arms around herself,
‘it’s getting closer.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just a noise,’ Theodora said, and moved next to Eleanor
and sat tight against her. ‘It has an echo.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It sounded, Eleanor thought, like a hollow noise, a hollow
bang, as though something were hitting the doors with an
iron kettle, or an iron bar, or an iron glove. It pounded
regularly for a minute, and then suddenly more softly, and
then again in a quick flurry, seeming to be going methodically
from door to door at the end of the hall. Distantly
she thought she could hear the voices of Luke and the
doctor, calling from somewhere below, and she thought,
<span class="it">Then they are not up here with us at all</span>, and heard the
iron crashing against what must have been a door very
close.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Maybe it will go on down the other side of the hall,’
Theodora whispered, and Eleanor thought that the oddest
part of this indescribable experience was that Theodora
should be having it too. ‘No,’ Theodora said, and they heard
the crash against the door across the hall. It was louder, it
was deafening, it struck against the door next to them (did
it move back and forth across the hall? did it go on feet
along the carpet? did it lift a hand to the door?), and
Eleanor threw herself away from the bed and ran to hold
her hands against the door. ‘Go away,’ she shouted wildly.
‘Go away, go away!’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was complete silence, and Eleanor thought, standing
with her face against the door, Now I’ve done it; it was
looking for the room with someone inside.</p>

<p class="pindent">The cold crept and pinched at them, filling and overflowing
the room. Anyone would have thought that the inhabitants
of Hill House slept sweetly in this quiet, and then, so
suddenly that Eleanor wheeled around, the sound of Theodora’s
teeth chattering, and Eleanor laughed. ‘You big baby,’
she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m cold,’ Theodora said. ‘Deadly cold.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So am I.’ Eleanor took the green quilt and threw it
around Theodora, and took up Theodora’s warm dressing-gown
and put it on. ‘You warmer now?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Where’s Luke? Where’s the doctor?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t know. Are you warmer now?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No.’ Theodora shivered.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In a minute I’ll go out in the hall and call them; are
you——’</p>

<p class="pindent">It started again, as though it had been listening, waiting
to hear their voices and what they said, to identify them,
to know how well prepared they were against it, waiting to
hear if they were afraid. So suddenly that Eleanor leaped
back against the bed and Theodora gasped and cried out,
the iron crash came against their door, and both of them
lifted their eyes in horror, because the hammering was
against the upper edge of the door, higher than either of
them could reach, higher than Luke or the doctor could
reach, and the sickening, degrading cold came in waves
from whatever was outside the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor stood perfectly still and looked at the door. She
did not quite know what to do, although she believed
that she was thinking coherently and was not unusually
frightened, not more frightened, certainly, than she had believed
in her worst dreams she could be. The cold troubled
her even more than the sounds; even Theodora’s warm robe
was useless against the icy little curls of fingers on her back.
The intelligent thing to do, perhaps, was to walk over and
open the door; that, perhaps, would belong with the doctor’s
views of pure scientific inquiry. Eleanor knew that, even if
her feet would take her as far as the door, her hand would
not lift to the door-knob; impartially, remotely, she told herself
that no one’s hand would touch that knob; it’s not the
work hands were made for, she told herself. She had been
rocking a little, each crash against the door pushing her a
little backward, and now she was still because the noise
was fading. ‘I’m going to complain to the janitor about
the radiators,’ Theodora said from behind her. ‘Is it
stopping?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ Eleanor said, sick. ‘No.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It had found them. Since Eleanor would not open the
door, it was going to make its own way in. Eleanor said
aloud, ‘Now I know why people scream, because I think
I’m going to,’ and Theodora said, ‘I will if you will,’ and
laughed, so that Eleanor turned quickly back to the bed and
they held each other, listening in silence. Little pattings
came from around the door-frame, small seeking sounds,
feeling the edges of the door, trying to sneak a way in. The
door-knob was fondled, and Eleanor, whispering, asked, ‘Is
it locked?’ and Theodora nodded and then, wide-eyed,
turned to stare at the connecting bathroom door. ‘Mine’s
locked too,’ Eleanor said against her ear, and Theodora
closed her eyes in relief. The little sticky sounds moved on
around the door-frame and then, as though a fury caught
whatever was outside, the crashing came again, and Eleanor
and Theodora saw the wood of the door tremble and shake,
and the door move against its hinges.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You can’t get in,’ Eleanor said wildly, and again there
was a silence, as though the house listened with attention
to her words, understanding, cynically agreeing, content to
wait. A thin little giggle came, in a breath of air through
the room, a little mad rising laugh, the smallest whisper of
a laugh, and Eleanor heard it all up and down her back, a
little gloating laugh moving past them around the house,
and then she heard the doctor and Luke calling from the
stairs and, mercifully, it was over.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the real silence came, Eleanor breathed shakily
and moved stiffly. ‘We’ve been clutching each other like a
couple of lost children,’ Theodora said and untwined her
arms from around Eleanor’s neck. ‘You’re wearing my bathrobe.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I forgot mine. Is it really over?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘For tonight, anyway.’ Theodora spoke with certainty.
‘Can’t you tell? Aren’t you warm again?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The sickening cold was gone, except for a reminiscent
little thrill of it down Eleanor’s back when she looked at
the door. She began to pull at the tight knot she had put
in the bathrobe cord, and said, ‘Intense cold is one of the
symptoms of shock.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Intense shock is one of the symptoms I’ve got,’ Theodora
said. ‘Here come Luke and the doctor.’ Their voices were
outside in the hall, speaking quickly, anxiously, and Eleanor
dropped Theodora’s robe on the bed and said, ‘For heaven’s
sake, don’t let them knock on that door—one more knock
would finish me’—and ran into her own room to get her
own robe. Behind her she could hear Theodora telling them
to wait a minute, and then going to unlock the door, and
then Luke’s voice saying pleasantly to Theodora, ‘Why, you
look as though you’d seen a ghost.’</p>

<p class="pindent">When Eleanor came back she noticed that both Luke and
the doctor were dressed, and it occurred to her that it might
be a sound idea from now on; if that intense cold was going
to come back at night it was going to find Eleanor sleeping
in a wool suit and a heavy sweater, and she didn’t care what
Mrs Dudley was going to say when she found that at least
one of the lady guests was lying in one of the clean beds
in heavy shoes and wool socks. ‘Well,’ she asked, ‘how do
you gentlemen like living in a haunted house?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s perfectly fine,’ Luke said, ‘perfectly fine. It gives me
an excuse to have a drink in the middle of the night.’ He
had the brandy bottle and glasses, and Eleanor thought that
they must make a companionable little group, the four of
them, sitting around Theodora’s room at four in the morning,
drinking brandy. They spoke lightly, quickly, and gave
one another fast, hidden, little curious glances, each of
them wondering what secret terror had been tapped in the
others, what changes might show in face or gesture,
what unguarded weakness might have opened the way to
ruin.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Did anything happen in here while we were outside?’
the doctor asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor and Theodora looked at each other and laughed,
honestly at last, without any edge of hysteria or fear. After
a minute Theodora said carefully, ‘Nothing in particular.
Someone knocked on the door with a cannon ball and then
tried to get in and eat us, and started laughing its head off
when we wouldn’t open the door. But nothing really out of
the way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Curiously, Eleanor went over and opened the door. ‘I
thought the whole door was going to shatter,’ she said, bewildered,
‘and there isn’t even a scratch on the wood, nor
on any of the other doors; they’re perfectly smooth.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How nice that it didn’t mar the woodwork,’ Theodora
said, holding her brandy glass out to Luke. ‘I couldn’t bear
it if this dear old house got hurt.’ She grinned at Eleanor.
‘Nellie here was going to scream.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So were you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not at all; I only said so to keep you company. Besides,
Mrs Dudley already said she wouldn’t come. And where
were <span class="it">you</span>, our manly defenders?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We were chasing a dog,’ Luke said. ‘At least, some animal
like a dog.’ He stopped, and then went on reluctantly. ‘We
followed it outside.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora stared, and Eleanor said, ‘You mean it was
<span class="it">inside</span>?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I saw it run past my door,’ the doctor said, ‘just caught
a glimpse of it, slipping along. I woke Luke and we followed
it down the stairs and out into the garden and lost it somewhere
at the back of the house?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The front door was open?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ Luke said. ‘The front door was closed. So were all
the other doors. We checked.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ve been wandering around for quite a while,’ the
doctor said. ‘We never dreamed that you ladies were awake
until we heard your voices.’ He spoke gravely. ‘There is one
thing we have not taken into account,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">They looked at him, puzzled, and he explained, checking
on his fingers in his lecture style. ‘First,’ he said, ‘Luke and
I were awakened earlier than you ladies, clearly; we have
been up and about, outside and in, for better than two hours,
led on what you perhaps might allow me to call a wild-goose
chase. Second, neither of us’—he glanced inquiringly
at Luke as he spoke—‘heard any sound up here until your
voices began. It was perfectly quiet. That is, the sound
which hammered on your door was not audible to us. When
we gave up our vigil and decided to come upstairs we
apparently drove away whatever was waiting outside your
door. Now, as we sit here together, all is quiet.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I still don’t see what you mean,’ Theodora said, frowning.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We must take precautions,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Against what? How?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘When Luke and I are called outside, and you two are
kept imprisoned inside, doesn’t it begin to seem’—and his
voice was very quiet—‘doesn’t it begin to seem that the
intention is, somehow, to separate us?’</p>

<h2><a name="chap05"></a>FIVE</h2>

<p class="noindent">Looking at herself in the mirror, with the bright morning
sunlight freshening even the blue room of Hill House,
Eleanor thought, It is my second morning in Hill House,
and I am unbelievably happy. Journeys end in lovers
meeting; I have spent an all but sleepless night, I have told
lies and made a fool of myself, and the very air tastes like
wine. I have been frightened half out of my foolish wits, but
I have somehow earned this joy; I have been waiting for it
for so long. Abandoning a lifelong belief that to name
happiness is to dissipate it, she smiled at herself in the
mirror and told herself silently, You are happy, Eleanor, you
have finally been given a part of your measure of happiness.
Looking away from her own face in the mirror, she
thought blindly, Journeys end in lovers meeting, lovers
meeting.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Luke?’ It was Theodora, calling outside in the hall. ‘You
carried off one of my stockings last night, and you are a
thieving cad, and I hope Mrs Dudley can hear me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor could hear Luke, faintly, answering; he protested
that a gentleman had a right to keep the favours bestowed
upon him by a lady, and he was absolutely certain that Mrs
Dudley could hear every word.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor?’ Now Theodora pounded on the connecting
door. ‘Are you awake? May I come in?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Come, of course,’ Eleanor said, looking at her own face in
the mirror. You deserve it, she told herself, you have spent
your life earning it. Theodora opened the door and said
happily, ‘How pretty you look this morning, my Nell. This
curious life agrees with you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor smiled at her; the life clearly agreed with Theodora
too.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We ought by rights to be walking around with dark
circles under our eyes and a look of wild despair,’ Theodora
said, putting an arm around Eleanor and looking into the
mirror beside her, ‘and look at us—two blooming, fresh
young lovelies.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m thirty-four years old,’ Eleanor said, and wondered
what obscure defiance made her add two years.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And you look about fourteen,’ Theodora said. ‘Come
along; we’ve earned our breakfast.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Laughing, they raced down the great staircase and found
their way through the game room and into the dining-room.
‘Good morning,’ Luke said brightly. ‘And how did everyone
sleep?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Delightfully, thank you,’ Eleanor said. ‘Like a baby.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There may have been a little noise,’ Theodora said, ‘but
one has to expect that in these old houses. Doctor, what do
we do this morning?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hm?’ said the doctor, looking up. He alone looked tired,
but his eyes were lighted with the same brightness they
found, all, in one another; it is excitement, Eleanor thought;
we are all enjoying ourselves.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ballechin House,’ the doctor said, savouring his words.
‘Borley Rectory. Glamis Castle. It is incredible to find oneself
experiencing it, absolutely incredible. I could <span class="it">not</span> have
believed it. I begin to understand, dimly, the remote delight
of your true medium. I think I shall have the marmalade,
if you would be so kind. Thank you. My wife will never
believe me. Food has a new flavour—do you find it so?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It isn’t just that Mrs Dudley has surpassed herself, then;
I was wondering,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve been trying to remember,’ Eleanor said. ‘About last
night, I mean. I can remember <span class="it">knowing</span> that I was frightened,
but I can’t imagine actually <span class="it">being</span> frightened——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I remember the cold,’ Theodora said, and shivered.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think it’s because it was so unreal by any pattern of
thought I’m used to; I mean, it just didn’t make <span class="it">sense</span>.’
Eleanor stopped and laughed, embarrassed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I agree,’ Luke said. ‘I found myself this morning <span class="it">telling</span>
myself what had happened last night; the reverse of a bad
dream, as a matter of fact, where you keep telling yourself
that it <span class="it">didn’t</span> really happen.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I thought it was exciting,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor lifted a warning finger. ‘It is still perfectly
possible that it is all caused by subterranean waters.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then more houses ought to be built over secret springs,’
Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor frowned. ‘This excitement troubles me,’ he
said. ‘It is intoxicating, certainly, but might it not also be
dangerous? An effect of the atmosphere of Hill House? The
first sign that we have—as it were—fallen under a spell?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then I will be an enchanted princess,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And yet,’ Luke said, ‘if last night is a true measure of
Hill House, we are not going to have much trouble; we
were frightened, certainly, and found the experience unpleasant
while it was going on, and yet I cannot remember
that I felt in any <span class="it">physical</span> danger; even Theodora telling
that whatever was outside her door was coming to eat her
did not really sound——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I know what she meant,’ Eleanor said, ‘because I thought
it was exactly the right word. The sense was that it wanted
to consume us, take us into itself, make us a part of the
house, maybe—oh, dear. I thought I knew what I was saying,
but I’m doing it very badly.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No physical danger exists,’ the doctor said positively. ‘No
ghost in all the long histories of ghosts has ever hurt anyone
physically. The only damage done is by the victim to himself.
One cannot even say that the ghost attacks the mind,
because the mind, the conscious, thinking mind, is invulnerable;
in all our conscious minds, as we sit here talking, there
is not one iota of belief in ghosts. Not one of us, even after
last night, can say the word “ghost” without a little involuntary
smile. No, the menace of the supernatural is that it
attacks where modern minds are weakest, where we have
abandoned our protective armour of superstition and have
no substitute defence. Not one of us thinks rationally that
what ran through the garden last night was a ghost, and
what knocked on the door was a ghost, and yet there was
certainly <span class="it">something</span> going on in Hill House last night, and
the mind’s instinctive refuge—self-doubt—is eliminated. We
cannot say, “It was my imagination,” because three other
people were there too.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I could say,’ Eleanor put in, smiling, ‘ “All three of you
are in my imagination; none of this is real.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If I thought you could really believe that,’ the doctor said
gravely, ‘I would turn you out of Hill House this morning.
You would be venturing far too close to the state of mind
which would welcome the perils of Hill House with a kind
of sisterly embrace.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He means he would think you were batty, Nell
dear.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well,’ Eleanor said, ‘I expect I would be. If I had to take
sides with Hill House against the rest of you, I would expect
you to send me away.’ Why me, she wondered, why me?
Am I the public conscience? Expected always to say in cold
words what the rest of them are too arrogant to recognise?
Am I supposed to be the weakest, weaker than Theodora?
Of all of us, she thought, I am surely the one least likely to
turn against the others.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Poltergeists are another thing altogether,’ the doctor said,
his eyes resting briefly on Eleanor. ‘They deal entirely with
the physical world; they throw stones, they move objects,
they smash dishes; Mrs Foyster at Borley Rectory was a
long-suffering woman, but she finally lost her temper entirely
when her best teapot was hurled through the window.
Poltergeists, however, are rock-bottom on the supernatural
social scale; they are destructive, but mindless and will-less;
they are merely undirected force. Do you recall,’ he asked
with a little smile, ‘Oscar Wilde’s lovely story, “The Canterville
Ghost”?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The American twins who routed the fine old English
ghost,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Exactly. I have always liked the notion that the American
twins were actually a poltergeist phenomenon; certainly
poltergeists can overshadow any more interesting manifestation.
Bad ghosts drive out good.’ And he patted his hands
happily. ‘They drive out everything else, too,’ he added.
‘There is a manor in Scotland, infested with poltergeists,
where as many as seventeen spontaneous fires have broken
out in one day; poltergeists like to turn people out of bed
violently by tipping the bed end over end, and I remember
the case of a minister who was forced to leave his home
because he was tormented, day after day, by a poltergeist
who hurled at his head hymn books stolen from a rival
church.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly, without reason, laughter trembled inside
Eleanor; she wanted to run to the head of the table and hug
the doctor, she wanted to reel, chanting, across the stretches
of the lawn, she wanted to sing and to shout and to fling her
arms and move in great emphatic, possessing circles around
the rooms of Hill House; I am here, I am here, she thought.
She shut her eyes quickly in delight and then said demurely
to the doctor, ‘And what do we do today?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re still like a pack of children,’ the doctor said,
smiling too. ‘Always asking me what to do today. Can’t
you amuse yourselves with your toys? Or with each other?
I have work to do.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All I <span class="it">really</span> want to do’—and Theodora giggled—‘is slide
down that banister.’ The excited gaiety had caught her as
it had Eleanor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hide and seek,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Try not to wander around alone too much,’ the doctor
said. ‘I can’t think of a good reason why not, but it does
seem sensible.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Because there are bears in the woods,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And tigers in the attic,’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And an old witch in the tower, and a dragon in the
drawing-room.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am quite serious,’ the doctor said, laughing.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s ten o’clock. I clear——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good morning, Mrs Dudley,’ the doctor said, and Eleanor
and Theodora and Luke leaned back and laughed helplessly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I clear at ten o’clock.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We won’t keep you long. About fifteen minutes, please,
and then you can clear the table.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I clear breakfast at ten o’clock. I set on lunch at one.
Dinner I set on at six. It’s ten o’clock.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mrs Dudley,’ the doctor began sternly, and then, noticing
Luke’s face tight with silent laughter, lifted his napkin to
cover his eyes, and gave in. ‘You may clear the table, Mrs
Dudley,’ the doctor said brokenly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Happily, the sound of their laughter echoing along the
halls of Hill House and carrying to the marble group in
the drawing-room and the nursery upstairs and the odd little
top of the tower, they made their way down the passage
to their parlour and fell, still laughing, into chairs. ‘We must
not make fun of Mrs Dudley,’ the doctor said and leaned
forward, his face in his hands and his shoulders shaking.</p>

<p class="pindent">They laughed for a long time, speaking now and then
in half-phrases, trying to tell one another something, pointing
at one another wildly, and their laughter rocked Hill
House until, weak and aching, they lay back, spent, and
regarded one another. ‘Now——’ the doctor began, and was
stopped by a little giggling burst from Theodora.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now,’ the doctor said again, more severely, and they were
quiet. ‘I want more coffee,’ he said, appealing. ‘Don’t we all?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You mean go right in there and ask Mrs Dudley?’ Eleanor
asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Walk right up to her when it isn’t one o’clock or six
o’clock and just <span class="it">ask</span> her for some coffee?’ Theodora
demanded.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Roughly, yes,’ the doctor said. ‘Luke, my boy, I have observed
that you are already something of a favourite with
Mrs Dudley——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And how,’ Luke inquired with amazement, ‘did you ever
manage to observe anything so unlikely? Mrs Dudley regards
me with the same particular loathing she gives a dish
not properly on its shelf; in Mrs Dudley’s eyes——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You are, after all, the heir to the house,’ the doctor said
coaxingly. ‘Mrs Dudley must feel for you as an old family
retainer feels for the young master.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In Mrs Dudley’s eyes I am something lower than a
dropped fork. I beg of you, if you are contemplating asking
the old fool for something, send Theo, or our charming
Nell. <span class="it">They</span> are not afraid——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nope,’ Theodora said. ‘You can’t send a helpless female
to face down Mrs Dudley. Nell and I are here to be protected,
not to man the battlements for you cowards.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The doctor——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nonsense,’ the doctor said heartily. ‘You certainly
wouldn’t think of asking <span class="it">me</span>, an older man; anyway, you
<span class="it">know</span> she adores you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Insolent greybeard,’ Luke said. ‘Sacrificing me for a cup
of coffee. Do not be surprised, and I say it darkly, do not
be surprised if you lose your Luke in this cause; perhaps
Mrs Dudley has not yet had her own mid-morning snack,
and she is perfectly capable of a <span class="it">filet de Luke à la meunière</span>,
or perhaps <span class="it">dieppoise</span>, depending upon her mood; if I do
not return’—and he shook his finger warningly under the
doctor’s nose—‘I entreat you to regard your lunch with the
gravest suspicion.’ Bowing extravagantly, as befitted one off
to slay a giant, he closed the door behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Lovely Luke.’ Theodora stretched luxuriously.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Lovely Hill House,’ Eleanor said. ‘Theo, there is a kind
of little summerhouse in the side garden, all overgrown; I
noticed it yesterday. Can we explore it this morning?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Delighted,’ Theodora said. ‘I would not like to leave
one inch of Hill House uncherished. Anyway, it’s too nice
a day to stay inside.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ll ask Luke to come too,’ Eleanor said. ‘And you,
Doctor?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My notes——’ the doctor began, and then stopped as the
door opened so suddenly that in Eleanor’s mind was only
the thought that Luke had not dared face Mrs Dudley after
all, but had stood, waiting, pressed against the door; then,
looking at his white face and hearing the doctor say with
fury, ‘I broke my own first rule; I sent him alone,’ she found
herself only asking urgently, ‘Luke? Luke?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s all right,’ Luke even smiled. ‘But come into the long
hallway.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Chilled by his face and his voice and his smile, they got
up silently and followed him through the doorway into the
dark long hallway which led back to the front hall. ‘Here,’
Luke said, and a little winding shiver of sickness went down
Eleanor’s back when she saw that he was holding a lighted
match up to the wall.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s—writing?’ Eleanor asked, pressing closer to see.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Writing,’ Luke said. ‘I didn’t even notice it until I was
coming back. Mrs Dudley said no,’ he added, his voice
tight.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My flash.’ The doctor took his flashlight from his pocket,
and under its light, as he moved slowly from one end of the
hall to the other, the letters stood out clearly. ‘Chalk,’ the
doctor said, stepping forward to touch a letter with the tip
of his finger. ‘Written in chalk.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The writing was large and straggling and ought to have
looked, Eleanor thought, as though it had been scribbled
by bad boys on a fence. Instead, it was incredibly real, going
in broken lines over the thick panelling of the hallway.
From one end of the hallway to the other the letters went,
almost too large to read, even when she stood back against
the opposite wall.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Can you read it?’ Luke asked softly, and the doctor,
moving his flashlight, read slowly: <span style="font-size:smaller">HELP ELEANOR COME
HOME.</span></p>

<p class="pindent">‘No.’ And Eleanor felt the words stop in her throat; she
had seen her name as the doctor read it. It is me, she
thought. It is my name standing out there so clearly; I
should not be on the walls of this house. ‘Wipe it off, <span class="it">please</span>,’
she said, and felt Theodora’s arm go around her shoulders.
‘It’s <span class="it">crazy</span>,’ Eleanor said, bewildered.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Crazy is the word, all right,’ Theodora said strongly.
‘Come back inside, Nell, and sit down. Luke will get something
and wipe it off.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But it’s <span class="it">crazy</span>,’ Eleanor said, hanging back to see her
name on the wall. ‘<span class="it">Why——?</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Firmly the doctor put her through the door into the little
parlour and closed it; Luke had already attacked the
message with his handkerchief. ‘Now you listen to me,’ the
doctor said to Eleanor. ‘Just because your name——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s it,’ Eleanor said, staring at him. ‘It knows my name,
doesn’t it? It knows <span class="it">my</span> name.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Shut up, will you?’ Theodora shook her violently. ‘It could
have said any of us; it knows <span class="it">all</span> our names.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Did you write it?’ Eleanor turned to Theodora. ‘Please
tell me—I won’t be angry or anything, just so I can know
that—maybe it was only a joke? To frighten me?’ She
looked appealingly at the doctor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You know that none of us wrote it,’ the doctor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Luke came in, wiping his hands on his handkerchief, and
Eleanor turned hopefully. ‘Luke,’ she said, ‘you wrote it,
didn’t you? When you went out?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Luke stared, and then came to sit on the arm of her chair.
‘Listen,’ he said, ‘you want me to go writing your name
everywhere? Carving your initials on trees? Writing
“Eleanor, Eleanor” on little scraps of paper?’ He gave her
hair a soft little pull. ‘I’ve got more sense,’ he said. ‘Behave
yourself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then why me?’ Eleanor said, looking from one of them
to another; I am outside, she thought madly, I am the one
chosen, and she said quickly, beggingly, ‘Did I do something
to attract attention, more than anyone else?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No more than usual, dear,’ Theodora said. She was standing
by the fireplace, leaning on the mantel and tapping her
fingers, and when she spoke she looked at Eleanor with a
bright smile. ‘Maybe you wrote it yourself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Angry, Eleanor almost shouted. ‘You think I <span class="it">want</span> to see
my name scribbled all over this foul house? You think <span class="it">I</span> like
the idea that I’m the centre of attention? <span class="it">I</span>’m not the spoiled
baby, after all—<span class="it">I</span> don’t like being singled out——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Asking for help, did you notice?’ Theodora said lightly.
‘Perhaps the spirit of the poor little companion has found
a means of communication at last. Maybe she was only
waiting for some drab, timid——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Maybe it was only addressed to me because no possible
appeal for help could get through that iron selfishness of
yours; maybe I might have more sympathy and understanding
in one minute than——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And maybe, of course, you wrote it to yourself,’ Theodora
said again.</p>

<p class="pindent">After the manner of men who see women quarrelling, the
doctor and Luke had withdrawn, standing tight together
in miserable silence; now, at last, Luke moved and spoke.
‘That’s enough, Eleanor,’ he said, unbelievably, and Eleanor
whirled around, stamping. ‘How dare you?’ she said, gasping.
‘How <span class="it">dare</span> you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">And the doctor laughed, then, and she stared at him and
then at Luke, who was smiling and watching her. What is
wrong with me? she thought. Then—but they think Theodora
did it on purpose, made me mad so I wouldn’t be
frightened; how shameful to be manœuvred that way. She
covered her face and sat down in her chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nell, dear,’ Theodora said, ‘I <span class="it">am</span> sorry.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I must say something, Eleanor told herself; I must show
them that I am a good sport, after all; a good sport; let them
think that I am ashamed of myself. ‘<span class="it">I</span>’m sorry,’ she said. ‘I
was frightened.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course you were,’ the doctor said, and Eleanor
thought, How simple he is, how transparent; he believes
every silly thing he has ever heard. He thinks, even, that
Theodora shocked me out of hysteria. She smiled at him
and thought, Now I am back in the fold.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I really thought you were going to start shrieking,’ Theodora
said, coming to kneel by Eleanor’s chair. ‘<span class="it">I</span> would have,
in your place. But we can’t afford to have you break up,
you know.’</p>

<p class="pindent">We can’t afford to have anyone but Theodora in the centre
of the stage, Eleanor thought; if Eleanor is going to be the
outsider, she is going to be it all alone. She reached out
and patted Theodora’s head and said, ‘Thanks. I guess I was
kind of shaky for a minute.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I wondered if you two were going to come to blows,’
Luke said, ‘until I realised what Theodora was doing.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Smiling down into Theodora’s bright, happy eyes, Eleanor
thought, But that isn’t what Theodora was doing at all.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="pindent">Time passed lazily at Hill House. Eleanor and Theodora,
the doctor and Luke, alert against terror, wrapped around
by the rich hills and securely set into the warm, dark luxuries
of the house, were permitted a quiet day and a quiet night—enough,
perhaps, to dull them a little. They took their
meals together, and Mrs Dudley’s cooking stayed perfect.
They talked together and played chess; the doctor finished
<span class="it">Pamela</span> and began on <span class="it">Sir Charles Grandison</span>. A compelling
need for occasional privacy led them to spend some hours
alone in their separate rooms, without disturbance. Theodora
and Eleanor and Luke explored the tangled thicket
behind the house and found the little summerhouse, while
the doctor sat on the wide lawn, writing, within sight and
hearing. They found a walled-in rose garden, grown over
with weeds, and a vegetable garden tenderly nourished by
the Dudleys. They spoke often of arranging their picnic by
the brook. There were wild strawberries near the summerhouse,
and Theodora and Eleanor and Luke brought back
a handkerchief full and lay on the lawn near the doctor,
eating them, staining their hands and their mouths; like
children, the doctor told them, looking up with amusement
from his notes. Each of them had written—carelessly, and
with little attention to detail—an account of what they
thought they had seen and heard so far in Hill House, and
the doctor had put the papers away in his portfolio. The
next morning—their third morning in Hill House—the
doctor, aided by Luke, had spent a loving and maddening
hour on the floor of the upstairs hall, trying, with chalk and
measuring tape, to determine the precise dimensions of the
cold spot, while Eleanor and Theodora sat cross-legged on
the floor, noting down the doctor’s measurements, and
playing tic-tac-toe. The doctor was considerably hampered
in his work by the fact that, his hands repeatedly chilled
by the extreme cold, he could not hold either the chalk or
the tape for more than a minute at a time. Luke, inside the
nursery doorway, could hold one end of the tape until his
hand came into the cold spot, and then his fingers lost
strength and relaxed helplessly. A thermometer, dropped
into the centre of the cold spot, refused to register any
change at all, but continued doggedly maintaining that the
temperature there was the same as the temperature down
the rest of the hall, causing the doctor to fume wildly against
the statisticians of Borley Rectory, who had caught an
eleven-degree drop. When he had defined the cold spot as
well as he could, and noted his results in his notebook, he
brought them downstairs for lunch and issued a general
challenge to them, to meet him at croquet in the cool of the
afternoon.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It seems foolish,’ he explained, ‘to spend a morning as
glorious as this has been looking at a frigid place on a floor.
We must plan to spend more time outside’—and was mildly
surprised when they laughed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is there still a world somewhere?’ Eleanor asked wonderingly.
Mrs Dudley had made them a peach shortcake, and
she looked down at her plate and said, ‘I am sure Mrs
Dudley goes somewhere else at night, and she brings back
fresh cream each morning, and Dudley comes up with
groceries every afternoon, but as far as I can remember
there is no other place than this.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We are on a desert island,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I can’t picture any world but Hill House,’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps,’ Theodora said, ‘we should make notches on a
stick, or pile pebbles in a heap, one each day, so we will
know how long we have been marooned.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How pleasant not to have any word from outside.’ Luke
helped himself to an enormous heap of whipped cream. ‘No
letters, no newspapers; anything might be happening.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Unfortunately——’ the doctor said, and then stopped. ‘I
beg your pardon,’ he went on. ‘I meant only to say that word
<span class="it">will</span> be reaching us from outside, and of course it is not
unfortunate at all. Mrs Montague—my wife, that is—will
be here on Saturday.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But when is Saturday?’ Luke asked. ‘Delighted to see Mrs
Montague, of course.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Day after tomorrow.’ The doctor thought. ‘Yes,’ he said
after a minute, ‘I believe that the day after tomorrow is
Saturday. We will know it is Saturday, of course,’ he told
them with a little twinkle, ‘because Mrs Montague will be
here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hope she is not holding high hopes of things going
bump in the night,’ Theodora said. ‘Hill House has fallen far
short of its original promise, I think. Or perhaps Mrs
Montague will be greeted with a volley of psychic experiences.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mrs Montague,’ the doctor said, ‘will be perfectly ready
to receive them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I wonder,’ Theodora said to Eleanor as they left the lunch
table under Mrs Dudley’s watchful eye, ‘why everything <span class="it">has</span>
been so quiet. I think this waiting is nerve-racking, almost
worse than having something happen.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s not us doing the waiting,’ Eleanor said. ‘It’s the house.
I think it’s biding its time.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Waiting until we feel secure, maybe, and then it will
pounce.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I wonder how long it can wait.’ Eleanor shivered and
started up the great staircase. ‘I am almost tempted to write
a letter to my sister. You know—“Having a perfectly <span class="it">splendid</span>
time here in jolly old Hill House.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ “You really must plan to bring the whole family next
summer,” ’ Theodora went on. ‘ “We sleep under blankets
every night.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ “The air is so bracing, particularly in the upstairs
hall.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ “You go around all the time just glad to be alive.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ “There’s something going on every minute.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ “Civilisation seems so far away.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor laughed. She was ahead of Theodora, at the top
of the stairs. The dark hallway was a little lightened this
afternoon, because they had left the nursery door open and
the sunlight came through the windows by the tower and
touched the doctor’s measuring tape and chalk on the floor.
The light reflected from the stained-glass window on the
stair landing and made shattered fragments of blue and
orange and green on the dark wood of the hall. ‘I’m going
to sleep,’ she said. ‘I’ve never been so lazy in my life.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m going to lie on my bed and dream about streetcars,’
Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">It had become Eleanor’s habit to hesitate in the doorway
of her room, glancing around quickly before she went inside;
she told herself that this was because the room was so
exceedingly blue and always took a moment to get used to.
When she came inside she went across to open the window,
which she always found closed; today she was half-way
across the room before she heard Theodora’s door slam back,
and Theodora’s smothered ‘Eleanor!’ Moving quickly,
Eleanor ran into the hall and to Theodora’s doorway, to
stop, aghast, looking over Theodora’s shoulder. ‘What <span class="it">is</span> it?’
she whispered.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What does it <span class="it">look</span> like?’ Theodora’s voice rose crazily.
‘What does it <span class="it">look</span> like, you fool?’</p>

<p class="pindent">And I won’t forgive her <span class="it">that</span>, either, Eleanor thought
concretely through her bewilderment. ‘It looks like paint,’
she said hesitantly. ‘Except’—realising—‘except the smell is
awful.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s blood,’ Theodora said with finality. She clung to the
door, swaying as the door moved, staring. ‘Blood,’ she said.
‘All over. Do you see it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course I see it. And it’s not <span class="it">all</span> over. Stop making such
a fuss.’ Although, she thought conscientiously, Theodora
was making very little of a fuss, actually. One of these times,
she thought, one of us <span class="it">is</span> going to put her head back and
really howl, and I hope it won’t be me, because I’m trying
to guard against it; it <span class="it">will</span> be Theodora who .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And then,
cold, she asked, ‘Is that more writing on the wall?’—and
heard Theodora’s wild laugh, and thought, Maybe it will
be me, after all, and I can’t afford to. I must be steady, and
she closed her eyes and found herself saying silently, O stay
and hear, your true love’s coming, that can sing both high
and low. Trip no further, pretty sweeting; journeys end in
lovers meeting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes indeed, dear,’ Theodora said. ‘I don’t know how you
managed it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Every wise man’s son doth know. ‘Be sensible,’ Eleanor
said. ‘Call Luke. And the doctor.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why?’ Theodora asked. ‘Wasn’t it to be just a little private
surprise for me? A secret just for the two of us?’ Then,
pulling away from Eleanor, who tried to hold her from going
farther into the room, she ran to the great wardrobe and
threw open the door and, cruelly, began to cry. ‘My clothes,’
she said. ‘My clothes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Steadily Eleanor turned and went to the top of the stairs.
‘Luke,’ she called, leaning over the banisters. ‘Doctor.’ Her
voice was not loud, and she had tried to keep it level, but
she heard the doctor’s book drop to the floor and then the
pounding of feet as he and Luke ran for the stairs. She
watched them, seeing their apprehensive faces, wondering
at the uneasiness which lay so close below the surface in all
of them, so that each of them seemed always waiting for a
cry for help from one of the others; intelligence and understanding
are really no protection at all, she thought. ‘It’s
Theo,’ she said as they came to the top of the stairs. ‘She’s
hysterical. Someone—something—has got red paint in her
room, and she’s crying over her clothes.’ Now I could not
have put it more fairly than that, she thought, turning to
follow them. Could I have put it more fairly than that? she
asked herself, and found that she was smiling.</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora was still sobbing wildly in her room and kicking
at the wardrobe door, in a tantrum that might have been
laughable if she had not been holding her yellow shirt,
matted and stained; her other clothes had been torn from
the hangers and lay trampled and disordered on the wardrobe
floor, all of them smeared and reddened. ‘What is it?’
Luke asked the doctor, and the doctor, shaking his head,
said, ‘I would swear that it was blood, and yet to get so
much blood one would almost have to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ and then was
abruptly quiet.</p>

<p class="pindent">All of them stood in silence for a moment and looked at
<span style="font-size:smaller">HELP ELEANOR COME HOME ELEANOR</span> written in shaky red
letters on the wallpaper over Theodora’s bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">This time I am ready, Eleanor told herself, and said,
‘You’d better get her out of here; bring her into my room.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My clothes are ruined,’ Theodora said to the doctor. ‘Do
you see my clothes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The smell was atrocious, and the writing on the wall had
dripped and splattered. There was a line of drops from the
wall to the wardrobe—perhaps what had first turned Theodora’s
attention that way—and a great irregular stain on the
green rug. ‘It’s disgusting,’ Eleanor said. ‘Please get Theo
into my room.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Luke and the doctor between them persuaded Theodora
through the bathroom and into Eleanor’s room, and Eleanor,
looking at the red paint (It must be paint, she told herself;
it’s simply <span class="it">got</span> to be paint; what else <span class="it">could</span> it be?), said
aloud, ‘But <span class="it">why?</span>’—and stared up at the writing on the wall.
Here lies one, she thought gracefully, whose name was writ
in blood; is it possible that I am not quite coherent at this
moment?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is she all right?’ she asked, turning as the doctor came
back into the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She will be in a few minutes. We’ll have to move her in
with you for a while, I should think; I can’t imagine her
wanting to sleep in <span class="it">here</span> again.’ The doctor smiled a little
wanly. ‘It will be a long time, I think, before she opens
another door by herself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I suppose she’ll have to wear my clothes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I suppose she will, if you don’t mind.’ The doctor looked
at her curiously. ‘This message troubles you less than the
other?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s too silly,’ Eleanor said, trying to understand her own
feelings. ‘I’ve been standing here looking at it and just
wondering <span class="it">why</span>. I mean, it’s like a joke that didn’t come off;
I was supposed to be <span class="it">much</span> more frightened than this, I
think, and I’m not because it’s simply <span class="it">too</span> horrible to be
real. And I keep remembering Theo putting red polish .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’
She giggled, and the doctor looked at her sharply, but she
went on, ‘It might as <span class="it">well</span> be paint, don’t you see?’ I can’t
stop talking, she thought; what do <span class="it">I</span> have to explain in all
this? ‘Maybe I can’t take it seriously,’ she said, ‘after the
sight of Theo screaming over her poor clothes and accusing
me of writing my name all over her wall. Maybe I’m getting
used to her blaming me for everything.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nobody’s blaming you for anything,’ the doctor said, and
Eleanor felt that she had been reproved.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hope my clothes will be good enough for her,’ she said
tartly.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor turned, looking around the room; he touched
one finger gingerly to the letters on the wall and moved
Theodora’s yellow shirt with his foot. ‘Later,’ he said absently.
‘Tomorrow, perhaps.’ He glanced at Eleanor and
smiled. ‘I can make an exact sketch of this,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I can help you,’ Eleanor said. ‘It makes me sick, but it
doesn’t frighten me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ the doctor said. ‘I think we’d better close up the
room for now, however; we don’t want Theodora blundering
in here again. Then later, at my leisure, I can study it.
Also,’ he said with a flash of amusement, ‘I would not like
to have Mrs Dudley coming in here to straighten up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor watched silently while he locked the hall door
from inside the room, and then they went through the bathroom
and he locked the connecting door into Theodora’s
green room. ‘I’ll see about moving in another bed,’ he said,
and then, with some awkwardness, ‘You’ve kept your head
well, Eleanor; it’s a help to me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I told you, it makes me sick but it doesn’t frighten me,’
she said, pleased, and turned to Theodora. Theodora was
lying on Eleanor’s bed, and Eleanor saw with a queasy turn
that Theodora had got red on her hands and it was rubbing
off on to Eleanor’s pillow. ‘Look,’ she said harshly, coming
over to Theodora, ‘you’ll have to wear my clothes until you
get new ones, or until we get the others cleaned.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Cleaned?’ Theodora rolled convulsively on the bed and
pressed her stained hands against her eyes. ‘<span class="it">Cleaned?</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘For heaven’s sake,’ Eleanor said, ‘let me wash you off.’
She thought, without trying to find a reason, that she had
never felt such uncontrollable loathing for any person before,
and she went into the bathroom and soaked a towel and
came back to scrub roughly at Theodora’s hands and face.
‘You’re filthy with the stuff,’ she said, hating to touch Theodora.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly Theodora smiled at her. ‘I don’t really think you
did it,’ she said, and Eleanor turned to see that Luke was
behind her, looking down at them. ‘What a fool I am,’
Theodora said to him, and Luke laughed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You will be a delight in Nell’s red sweater,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">She is wicked, Eleanor thought, beastly and soiled and
dirty. She took the towel into the bathroom and left it to
soak in cold water; when she came out Luke was saying,
‘.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. another bed in here; you girls are going to share a
room from now on.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Share a room and share our clothes,’ Theodora said.
‘We’re going to be practically twins.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Cousins,’ Eleanor said, but no one heard her.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘It was the custom, rigidly adhered to,’ Luke said, turning
the brandy in his glass, ‘for the public executioner, before
a quartering, to outline his knife strokes in chalk upon the
belly of his victim—for fear of a slip, you understand.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I would like to hit her with a stick, Eleanor thought,
looking down on Theodora’s head beside her chair; I would
like to batter her with rocks.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘An exquisite refinement, exquisite. Because of course the
chalk strokes would have been almost unbearable, excruciating,
if the victim were ticklish.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I hate her, Eleanor thought, she sickens me; she is all
washed and clean and wearing my red sweater.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘When the death was by hanging in chains, however, the
executioner .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nell?’ Theodora looked up at her and smiled. ‘I really
am sorry, you know,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">I would like to watch her dying, Eleanor thought, and
smiled back and said, ‘Don’t be silly.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Among the Sufis there is a teaching that the universe has
never been created and consequently cannot be destroyed.
I have spent the afternoon,’ Luke announced gravely,
‘browsing in our little library.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor sighed. ‘No chess tonight, I think,’ he said to
Luke, and Luke nodded. ‘It has been an exhausting day,’
the doctor said, ‘and I think you ladies should retire early.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not until I am well dulled with brandy,’ Theodora said
firmly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fear,’ the doctor said, ‘is the relinquishment of logic, the
<span class="it">willing</span> relinquishing of reasonable patterns. We yield to it
or we fight it, but we cannot meet it half-way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I was wondering earlier,’ Eleanor said, feeling she had
somehow an apology to make to all of them. ‘I thought I
was altogether calm, and yet now I know I was terribly
afraid.’ She frowned, puzzled, and they waited for her to
go on. ‘When I <span class="it">am</span> afraid, I can see perfectly the sensible,
beautiful not-afraid side of the world, I can see chairs and
tables and windows staying the same, not affected in the
least, and I can see things like the carefully woven texture of
the carpet, not even moving. But when I am afraid I no
longer exist in any relation to these things. I suppose
because things are <span class="it">not</span> afraid.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think we are only afraid of ourselves,’ the doctor said
slowly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ Luke said. ‘Of seeing ourselves clearly and without
disguise.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of knowing what we really want,’ Theodora said. She
pressed her cheek against Eleanor’s hand and Eleanor,
hating the touch of her, took her hand away quickly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am always afraid of being alone,’ Eleanor said, and
wondered, Am <span class="it">I</span> talking like this? Am I saying something
I will regret bitterly tomorrow? Am I making more guilt
for myself? ‘Those letters spelled out <span class="it">my</span> name, and none of
you know what that feels like—it’s so <span class="it">familiar</span>.’ And she
gestured to them, almost in appeal. ‘Try to <span class="it">see</span>,’ she said.
‘It’s my own dear name, and it belongs to me, and something
is using it and writing it and calling me with it and
my own <span class="it">name</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ She stopped and said, looking from one
of them to another, even down on to Theodora’s face looking
up at her, ‘Look. There’s only one of me, and it’s all I’ve
got. I <span class="it">hate</span> seeing myself dissolve and slip and separate so
that I’m living in one half, my mind, and I see the other
half of me helpless and frantic and driven and I can’t stop
it, but I know I’m not really going to be hurt and yet time
is so long and even a second goes on and on and I could
stand any of it if I could only surrender——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Surrender?</span>’ said the doctor sharply, and Eleanor stared.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Surrender?’ Luke repeated.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t know,’ Eleanor said, perplexed. I was just talking
along, she told herself, I was saying something—what was
I just saying?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She has done this before,’ Luke said to the doctor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I know,’ said the doctor gravely, and Eleanor could feel
them all looking at her. ‘I’m sorry,’ she said. ‘Did I make
a fool of myself? It’s probably because I’m afraid.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not at all,’ the doctor said, still grave. ‘Drink your
brandy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Brandy?’ And Eleanor looked down, realising that she
held a brandy glass. ‘What did I <span class="it">say</span>?’ she asked them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora chuckled. ‘Drink,’ she said. ‘You need it, my
Nell.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Obediently Eleanor sipped at her brandy, feeling clearly
its sharp burn, and then said to the doctor, ‘I must have said
something silly, from the way you’re all staring at me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor laughed. ‘Stop trying to be the centre of
attention.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Vanity,’ Luke said serenely.</p>

<p class="pindent">'Have to be in the limelight,’ Theodora said, and they
smiled fondly, all looking at Eleanor.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class="pindent">Sitting up in the two beds beside each other, Eleanor and
Theodora reached out between and held hands tight; the
room was brutally cold and thickly dark. From the room
next door, the room which until that morning had been
Theodora’s, came the steady low sound of a voice babbling,
too low for words to be understood, too steady for disbelief.
Holding hands so hard that each of them could feel the
other’s bones, Eleanor and Theodora listened, and the low,
steady sound went on and on, the voice lifting sometimes
for an emphasis on a mumbled word, falling sometimes to
a breath, going on and on. Then, without warning, there
was a little laugh, the small gurgling laugh that broke
through the babbling, and rose as it laughed, on up and up
the scale, and then broke off suddenly in a little painful gasp,
and the voice went on.</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora’s grasp loosened, and tightened, and Eleanor,
lulled for a minute by the sounds, started and looked across
to where Theodora ought to be in the darkness, and then
thought, screamingly, Why is it dark? <span class="it">Why is it dark?</span> She
rolled and clutched Theodora’s hand with both of hers, and
tried to speak and could not, and held on, blindly, and
frozen, trying to stand her mind on its feet, trying to reason
again. We left the light on, she told herself, so why is it
dark? Theodora, she tried to whisper, and her mouth could
not move; Theodora, she tried to ask, why is it dark? and
the voice went on, babbling, low and steady, a little liquid
gloating sound. She thought she might be able to distinguish
words if she lay perfectly still, if she lay perfectly still, and
listened, and listened and heard the voice going on and on,
never ceasing, and she hung desperately to Theodora’s hand
and felt an answering weight on her own hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then the little gurgling laugh came again, and the rising
mad sound of it drowned out the voice, and then suddenly
absolute silence. Eleanor took a breath, wondering if she
could speak now, and then she heard a little soft cry which
broke her heart, a little infinitely sad cry, a little sweet moan
of wild sadness. It is a <span class="it">child</span>, she thought with disbelief,
a child is crying somewhere, and then, upon that thought,
came the wild shrieking voice she had never heard before
and yet knew she had heard always in her nightmares. ‘Go
away!’ it screamed. ‘Go away, go away, don’t hurt me,’ and,
after, sobbing, ‘Please don’t hurt me. Please let me go home,’
and then the little sad crying again.</p>

<p class="pindent">I can’t stand it, Eleanor thought concretely. This is monstrous,
this is cruel, they have been hurting a child and I
won’t let anyone hurt a child, and the babbling went on,
low and steady, on and on and on, the voice rising a little
and falling a little, going on and on.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now, Eleanor thought, perceiving that she was lying sideways
on the bed in the black darkness, holding with both
hands to Theodora’s hand, holding so tight she could feel
the fine bones of Theodora’s fingers, now, I will not endure
this. They think to scare me. Well, they have. I am scared,
but more than that, I am a person, I am human, I am a
walking reasoning humorous human being and I will take a
lot from this lunatic filthy house but I will not go along
with hurting a child, no, I will not; I will by God get my
mouth to open right now and I will yell I will I will yell
‘STOP IT,’ she shouted, and the lights were on the way they
had left them and Theodora was sitting up in bed, startled
and dishevelled.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What?’ Theodora was saying. ‘What, Nell? What?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘God God,’ Eleanor said, flinging herself out of bed and
across the room to stand shuddering in a corner, ‘God God—whose
hand was I holding?’</p>

<h2><a name="chap06"></a>SIX</h2>

<p class="noindent">I am learning the pathways of the heart, Eleanor thought
quite seriously, and then wondered what she could have
meant by thinking any such thing. It was afternoon, and
she sat in the sunlight on the steps of the summerhouse
beside Luke; these are the silent pathways of the heart, she
thought. She knew that she was pale, and still shaken, with
dark circles under her eyes, but the sun was warm and the
leaves moved gently overhead, and Luke beside her lay
lazily against the step. ‘Luke,’ she asked, going slowly for
fear of ridicule, ‘why do people want to talk to each other?
I mean, what are the things people always want to find out
about other people?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What do you want to know about me, for instance?’ He
laughed. She thought, But why not ask what <span class="it">he</span> wants to
know about <span class="it">me</span>; he is so extremely vain—and laughed in
turn and said, ‘What can I <span class="it">ever</span> know about you, beyond
what I see?’ <span class="it">See</span> was the least of the words she might have
chosen, but the safest. Tell me something that only I will
ever know, was perhaps what she wanted to ask him, or,
What will you give me to remember you by?—or, even,
Nothing of the least importance has ever belonged to me;
can you help? Then she wondered if she had been foolish,
or bold, amazed at her own thoughts, but he only stared
down at the leaf he held in his hands and frowned a little,
as one who devotes himself completely to an absorbing
problem.</p>

<p class="pindent">He is trying to phrase everything to make as good an
impression as possible, she thought, and I will know how
he holds me by what he answers; how is he anxious to appear
to me? Does he think that I will be content with small
mysticism, or will he exert himself to seem unique? Is he
going to be gallant? That would be humiliating, because
then he would show that he knows that gallantry enchants
me; will he be mysterious? Mad? And how am I to receive
this, which I perceive already will be a confidence, even if
it is not true? Grant that Luke take me at my worth, she
thought, or at least let me not see the difference. Let him
be wise, or let me be blind; don’t let me, she hoped concretely,
don’t let me know too surely what he thinks of me.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he looked at her briefly and smiled what she was
coming to know as his self-deprecatory smile; did Theodora,
she wondered, and the thought was unwelcome, did Theodora
know him as well as this?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I never had a mother,’ he said, and the shock was enormous.
Is <span class="it">that</span> all he thinks of me, his estimate of what I
want to hear of him; will I enlarge this into a confidence
making me worthy of great confidences? Shall I sigh?
Murmur? Walk away? ‘No one ever loved me because I
belonged,’ he said. ‘I suppose you can understand that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">No, she thought, you are not going to catch me so cheaply;
I do not understand words and will not accept them in trade
for my feelings; this man is a parrot. I will tell him that I
can never understand such a thing, that maudlin self-pity
does not move directly at my heart; I will not make a fool
of myself by encouraging him to mock me. ‘I understand,
yes,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I thought you might,’ he said, and she wanted, quite
honestly, to slap his face. ‘I think you must be a very fine
person, Nell,’ he said, and then spoiled it by adding, ‘warm-hearted,
and honest. Afterwards, when you go home .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’
His voice trailed off, and she thought, Either he is beginning
to tell me something extremely important, or he is killing
time until this conversation can gracefully be ended. He
would not speak in this fashion without a reason; he does
not willingly give himself away. Does he think that a human
gesture of affection might seduce me into hurling myself
madly at him? Is he afraid that I cannot behave like a lady?
What does he know about me, about how I think and feel;
does he feel sorry for me? ‘Journeys end in lovers meeting,’
she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ he said. ‘I never had a mother, as I told you. Now
I find that everyone else has had something that I missed.’
He smiled at her. ‘I am entirely selfish,’ he said ruefully,
‘and always hoping that someone will tell me to behave,
someone will make herself responsible for me and make me
be grown-up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He is altogether selfish, she thought in some surprise, the
only man I have ever sat and talked to alone, and I am impatient;
he is simply not very interesting. ‘Why don’t you
grow up by yourself?’ she asked him, and wondered how
many people—how many women—had already asked him
that.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re clever.’ And how many times had he answered that
way?</p>

<p class="pindent">This conversation must be largely instinctive, she thought
with amusement, and said gently, ‘You must be a very lonely
person.’ All I want is to be cherished, she thought, and here
I am talking gibberish with a selfish man. ‘You must be very
lonely indeed.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He touched her hand, and smiled again. ‘You were so
lucky,’ he told her. ‘You had a mother.’</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘I found it in the library,’ Luke said. ‘I swear I found it
in the library.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Incredible,’ the doctor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Look,’ Luke said. He set the great book on the table and
turned to the title page. ‘He made it himself—look, the title’s
been lettered in ink: <span style="font-size:smaller">Memories</span>, <span class="it">for</span> <span style="font-size:smaller">Sophia Anne Lester
Crain</span>; <span class="it">A Legacy for Her Education and Enlightenment
During Her Lifetime From Her Affectionate and Devoted
Father</span>, <span style="font-size:smaller">Hugh Desmond Lester Crain</span>; <span class="it">Twenty-first June,
1881.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">They pressed around the table, Theodora and Eleanor and
the doctor, while Luke lifted and turned the first great page
of the book. ‘You see,’ Luke said, ‘his little girl is to learn
humility. He has clearly cut up a number of fine old books
to make this scrapbook, because I seem to recognise several
of the pictures, and they are all glued in.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The vanity of human accomplishment,’ the doctor said
sadly. ‘Think of the books Hugh Crain hacked apart to make
this. Now here is a Goya etching; a horrible thing for a
little girl to meditate upon.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Underneath he has written,’ Luke said, ‘under this ugly
picture: “Honour thy father and thy mother, Daughter,
authors of thy being, upon whom a heavy charge has been
laid, that they lead their child in innocence and righteousness
along the fearful narrow path to everlasting bliss, and
render her up at last to her God a pious and a virtuous soul;
reflect, Daughter, upon the joy in Heaven as the souls of
these tiny creatures wing upward, released before they have
learned aught of sin or faithlessness, and make it thine unceasing
duty to remain as pure as these.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Poor baby,’ Eleanor said, and gasped as Luke turned the
page; Hugh Crain’s second moral lesson derived from a
colour plate of a snake pit, and vividly painted snakes
writhed and twisted along the page, above the message,
neatly printed, and touched with gold: ‘Eternal damnation
is the lot of mankind; neither tears, nor reparation, can undo
Man’s heritage of sin. Daughter, hold apart from this world,
that its lusts and ingratitudes corrupt thee not; Daughter,
preserve thyself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Next comes hell,’ Luke said. ‘Don’t look if you’re
squeamish.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think I will skip hell,’ Eleanor said, ‘but read it to me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Wise of you,’ the doctor said. ‘An illustration from Foxe;
one of the less attractive deaths, I have always thought,
although who can fathom the ways of martyrs?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘See this, though,’ Luke said. ‘He’s burnt away a corner
of the page, and here is what he says: “Daughter, could you
but hear for a moment the agony, the screaming, the dreadful
crying out and repentance, of those poor souls condemned
to everlasting flame! Could thine eyes be seared,
but for an instant, with the red glare of wasteland burning
always! Alas, wretched beings, in undying pain! Daughter,
your father has this minute touched the corner of his page
to his candle, and seen the frail paper shrivel and curl in
the flame; consider, Daughter, that the heat of this candle
is to the everlasting fires of Hell as a grain of sand to the
reaching desert, and, as this paper burns in its slight flame
so shall your soul burn for ever, in fire a thousandfold more
keen.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll bet he read it to her every night before she went to
sleep,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Wait,’ Luke said. ‘You haven’t seen Heaven yet—even
<span class="it">you</span> can look at this one, Nell. It’s Blake, and a bit stern, I
think, but obviously better than Hell. Listen—“Holy, holy,
holy! In the pure light of heaven the angels praise Him and
one another unendingly. Daughter, it is Here that I will
seek thee.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What a labour of love it is,’ the doctor said. ‘Hours of
time just planning it, and the lettering is so dainty, and the
gilt——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now the seven deadly sins,’ Luke said, ‘and I think the
old boy drew them himself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He really put his heart into gluttony,’ Theodora said. ‘I’m
not sure I’ll ever be hungry again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Wait till lust,’ Luke told her. ‘The old fellow outdid
himself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t really want to look at any more of it, I think,’
Theodora said. ‘I’ll sit over here with Nell, and if you come
across any particularly edifying moral precepts you think
would do me good, read them aloud.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Here</span> is lust,’ Luke said. ‘Was ever woman in this humour
wooed?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good heavens,’ said the doctor. ‘Good heavens.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He <span class="it">must</span> have drawn it himself,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘For a <span class="it">child</span>?’ The doctor was outraged.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Her very own scrapbook. Note Pride, the very image of
our Nell here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What?’ said Eleanor, starting up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Teasing,’ the doctor said placatingly. ‘Don’t come to look,
my dear; he’s teasing you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sloth, now,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Envy,’ said the doctor. ‘How the poor child dared transgress .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The last page is the very nicest, I think. This, ladies, is
Hugh Crain’s blood. Nell, do you want to see Hugh Crain’s
blood?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, thank you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Theo? No? In any case, I insist, for the sake of your
two consciences, in reading what Hugh Crain has to say
in closing his book: “Daughter: sacred pacts are signed in
blood, and I have here taken from my own wrist the vital
fluid with which I bind you. Live virtuously, be meek, have
faith in thy Redeemer, and in me, thy father, and I swear
to thee that we will be joined together hereafter in unending
bliss. Accept these precepts from thy devoted father, who
in humbleness of spirit has made this book. May it serve
its purpose well, my feeble effort, and preserve my Child
from the pitfalls of this world and bring her safe to her
father’s arms in Heaven.” And signed: “Thy everloving
father, in this world and the next, author of thy being and
guardian of thy virtue; in meekest love, Hugh Crain.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora shuddered. ‘How he must have enjoyed it,’ she
said, ‘signing his name in his own blood; I can see him
laughing his head off.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not healthy, not at all a healthy work for a man,’ the
doctor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But she must have been very small when her father left
the house,’ Eleanor said. ‘I wonder if he ever did read it
to her.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m sure he did, leaning over her cradle and spitting out
the words so they would take root in her little mind. Hugh
Crain,’ Theodora said, ‘you were a dirty old man, and you
made a dirty old house and if you can still hear me from
anywhere I would like to tell you to your face that I
genuinely hope you will spend eternity in that foul horrible
picture and never stop burning for a minute.’ She made a
wild, derisive gesture around the room, and for a minute,
still remembering, they were all silent, as though waiting
for an answer, and then the coals in the fire fell with a little
crash, and the doctor looked at his watch and Luke rose.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The sun is over the yard-arm,’ the doctor said happily.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="pindent">Theodora curled by the fire, looking up wickedly at
Eleanor; at the other end of the room the chessmen moved
softly, jarring with little sounds against the table, and Theodora
spoke gently, tormentingly. ‘Will you have him at your
little apartment, Nell, and offer him to drink from your cup
of stars?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor looked into the fire, not answering. I have been
so silly, she thought, I have been a fool.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is there room enough for two? Would he come if you
asked him?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Nothing could be worse than this, Eleanor thought; I have
been a fool.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps he has been longing for a tiny home—something
smaller, of course, than Hill House; perhaps he will come
home with you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A fool, a ludicrous fool.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Your white curtains—your tiny stone lions——’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor looked down at her, almost gently. ‘But I <span class="it">had</span> to
come,’ she said, and stood up, turning blindly to get away.
Not hearing the startled voices behind her, not seeing where
or how she went, she blundered somehow to the great front
door and out into the soft warm night. ‘I <span class="it">had</span> to come,’ she
said to the world outside.</p>

<p class="pindent">Fear and guilt are sisters; Theodora caught her on the
lawn. Silent, angry, hurt, they left Hill House side by side,
walking together, each sorry for the other. A person angry,
or laughing, or terrified, or jealous, will go stubbornly on
into extremes of behaviour impossible at another time;
neither Eleanor nor Theodora reflected for a minute that it
was imprudent for them to walk far from Hill House after
dark. Each was so bent upon her own despair that escape
into darkness was vital, and, containing themselves in that
tight, vulnerable, impossible cloak which is fury, they
stamped along together, each achingly aware of the other,
each determined to be the last to speak.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor spoke first, finally; she had hurt her foot against
a rock and tried to be too proud to notice it, but after a
minute, her foot paining, she said, in a voice tight with the
attempt to sound level, ‘I can’t imagine why you think you
have any right to interfere in my affairs,’ her language
formal to prevent a flood of recrimination, or undeserved
reproach (were they not strangers? cousins?). ‘I am sure
that nothing I do is of any interest to you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">That’s right,’ Theodora said grimly. ‘Nothing that you
do is of any interest to me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">We are walking on either side of a fence, Eleanor thought,
but I have a right to live too, and I wasted an hour with
Luke at the summerhouse trying to prove it. ‘I hurt my foot,’
she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m sorry.’ Theodora sounded genuinely grieved. ‘You
know what a beast he is.’ She hesitated. ‘A rake,’ she said
finally, with a touch of amusement.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m sure it’s nothing to me <span class="it">what</span> he is.’ And then, because
they were women quarrelling, ‘As if <span class="it">you</span> cared, anyway.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He shouldn’t be allowed to get away with it,’ Theodora
said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Get away with <span class="it">what</span>?’ Eleanor asked daintily.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re making a fool of yourself,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Suppose I’m not, though? You’d mind terribly if you
turned out to be wrong this time, wouldn’t you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora’s voice was wearied, cynical. ‘If I’m wrong,’ she
said, ‘I will bless you with all my heart. Fool that you are.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You could hardly say anything else.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They were moving along the path towards the brook.
In the darkness their feet felt that they were going downhill,
and each privately and perversely accused the other of
taking, deliberately, a path they had followed together once
before in happiness.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Anyway,’ Eleanor said, in a reasonable tone, ‘it doesn’t
mean anything to you, no matter what happens. Why should
you care whether I make a fool of myself?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora was silent for a minute, walking in the darkness,
and Eleanor was suddenly absurdly sure that Theodora had
put out a hand to her, unseen. ‘Theo,’ Eleanor said awkwardly,
‘I’m no good at talking to people and saying things.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora laughed. ‘What <span class="it">are</span> you good at?’ she demanded.
‘Running away?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Nothing irrevocable had yet been spoken, but there was
only the barest margin of safety left them; each of them
moving delicately along the outskirts of an open question,
and, once spoken, such a question—as ‘Do you love me?’—could
never be answered or forgotten. They walked slowly,
meditating, wondering, and the path sloped down from their
feet and they followed, walking side by side in the most
extreme intimacy of expectation; their feinting and hesitation
done with, they could only wait passively for resolution.
Each knew, almost within a breath, what the other
was thinking and wanting to say; each of them almost wept
for the other. They perceived at the same moment the
change in the path and each knew then the other’s knowledge
of it; Theodora took Eleanor’s arm and, afraid to stop,
they moved on slowly, close together, and ahead of them
the path widened and blackened and curved.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor caught her breath, and Theodora’s hand tightened,
warning her to be quiet. On either side of them the trees,
silent, relinquished the dark colour they had held, paled,
grew transparent and stood white and ghastly against the
black sky. The grass was colourless, the path wide and black;
there was nothing else. Eleanor’s teeth were chattering, and
the nausea of fear almost doubled her; her arm shivered
under Theodora’s holding hand, now almost a clutch, and
she felt every slow step as a willed act, a precise mad insistence
upon the putting of one foot down after the other
as the only sane choice. Her eyes hurt with tears against the
screaming blackness of the path and the shuddering whiteness
of the trees, and she thought, with a clear intelligent
picture of the words in her mind, burning, Now I am really
afraid.</p>

<p class="pindent">They moved on, the path unrolling ahead of them, the
white trees unchanging on either side and, above all, the
black sky lying thick overhead; their feet were shimmering
white where they touched the path; Theodora’s hand was
pale and luminous. Ahead of them the path curved out of
sight, and they walked slowly on, moving their feet precisely
because it was the only physical act possible to them, the
only thing left to keep them from sinking into the awful
blackness and whiteness and luminous evil glow. Now I am
really afraid, Eleanor thought in words of fire; remotely she
could still feel Theodora’s hand on her arm, but Theodora
was distant, locked away; it was bitterly cold, with no human
warmth near. Now I am really afraid, Eleanor thought, and
put her feet forward one after another, shivering as they
touched the path, shivering with mindless cold.</p>

<p class="pindent">The path unwound; perhaps it was taking them somewhere,
wilfully, since neither of them could step off it and
go knowingly into the annihilation of whiteness that was the
grass on either side. The path curved, black and shining,
and they followed. Theodora’s hand tightened, and Eleanor
caught her breath on a little sob—had something moved,
ahead, something whiter than the white trees, beckoning?
Beckoning, fading into the trees, watching? Was there
movement beside them, imperceptible in the soundless
night; did some footstep go invisibly along with them in
the white grass? Where were they?</p>

<p class="pindent">The path led them to its destined end and died beneath
their feet. Eleanor and Theodora looked into a garden,
their eyes blinded with the light of sun and rich colour;
incredibly, there was a picnic party on the grass in the
garden. They could hear the laughter of the children and
the affectionate, amused voices of the mother and father;
the grass was richly, thickly green, the flowers were coloured
red and orange and yellow, the sky was blue and gold, and
one child wore a scarlet jumper and raised its voice again
in laughter, tumbling after a puppy over the grass. There
was a checked tablecloth spread out, and, smiling, the
mother leaned over to take up a plate of bright fruit; then
Theodora screamed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t look back,’ she cried out in a voice high with fear,
‘don’t look back—don’t look—run!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Running, without knowing why she ran, Eleanor thought
that she would catch her foot in the checked tablecloth; she
was afraid she might stumble over the puppy; but as they
ran across the garden there was nothing except weeds growing
blackly in the darkness, and Theodora, screaming still,
trampled over the bushes where there had been flowers and
stumbled, sobbing, over half-buried stones and what might
have been a broken cup. Then they were beating and
scratching wildly at the white stone wall where vines grew
blackly, screaming still and begging to be let out, until a
rusted iron gate gave way and they ran, crying and gasping
and somehow holding hands, across the kitchen garden of
Hill House, and crashed through a back door into the
kitchen to see Luke and the doctor hurrying to them. ‘What
happened?’ Luke said, catching at Theodora. ‘Are you all
right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ve been nearly crazy,’ the doctor said, worn. ‘We’ve
been out looking for you for hours.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was a picnic,’ Eleanor said. She had fallen into a
kitchen chair and she looked down at her hands, scratched
and bleeding and shaking without her knowledge. ‘We tried
to get out,’ she told them, holding her hands out for them
to see. ‘It was a picnic. The children .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora laughed in a little continuing cry, laughing on
and on thinly, and said through her laughter, ‘I looked
back—I went and looked behind us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ and laughed on.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The children .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and a puppy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor.’ Theodora turned wildly and put her head
against Eleanor. ‘Eleanor,’ she said. ‘Eleanor.’</p>

<p class="pindent">And, holding Theodora, Eleanor looked up at Luke and
the doctor, and felt the room rock madly, and time, as she
had always known time, stop.</p>

<h2><a name="chap07"></a>SEVEN</h2>

<p class="noindent">On the afternoon of the day when Mrs Montague was expected,
Eleanor went alone into the hills above Hill House,
not really intending to arrive at any place in particular, not
even caring where or how she went, wanting only to be
secret and out from under the heavy dark wood of the house.
She found a small spot where the grass was soft and dry
and lay down, wondering how many years it had been since
she had lain on soft grass to be alone to think. Around her
the trees and wild flowers, with that oddly courteous air of
natural things suddenly interrupted in their pressing occupations
of growing and dying, turned towards her with
attention, as though, dull and imperceptive as she was, it
was still necessary for them to be gentle to a creature so unfortunate
as not to be rooted in the ground, forced to go
from one place to another, heart-breakingly mobile. Idly
Eleanor picked a wild daisy, which died in her fingers,
and, lying on the grass, looked up into its dead face.
There was nothing in her mind beyond an overwhelming
wild happiness. She pulled at the daisy, and wondered,
smiling at herself, What am I going to do? What <span class="it">am</span> I
going to do?</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘Put the bags down in the hall, Arthur,’ Mrs Montague
said. ‘Wouldn’t you think there’d be someone here to help
us with this door? They’ll <span class="it">have</span> to get someone to take the
bags upstairs. John? John?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear, my dear.’ Dr Montague hurried into the hallway,
carrying his napkin, and kissed his wife obediently
on the cheek she held out for him. ‘How nice that you got
here; we’d given you up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I <span class="it">said</span> I’d be here today, didn’t I? Did you ever
know me <span class="it">not</span> to come when I said I would? I brought
Arthur.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Arthur,’ the doctor said without enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, <span class="it">some</span>body had to drive,’ Mrs Montague said. ‘I
imagine you expected that I would drive myself all the way
out here? Because you know perfectly well that I get tired.
How do you do.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor turned, smiling on Eleanor and Theodora,
with Luke behind them, clustered uncertainly in the doorway.
‘My dear,’ he said, ‘these are my friends who have
been staying in Hill House with me these past few days.
Theodora. Eleanor Vance. Luke Sanderson.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora and Eleanor and Luke murmured civilly, and
Mrs Montague nodded and said, ‘I see you didn’t bother to
wait dinner for us.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’d given you up,’ the doctor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I believe that I told you that I would be here today. Of
course, it is <span class="it">perfectly</span> possible that I am mistaken, but it is
<span class="it">my</span> recollection that I said I would be here today. I’m sure
I will get to know all your names very soon. This gentleman
is Arthur Parker; he drove me here because I dislike
driving myself. Arthur, these are John’s friends. Can anybody
do something about our suitcases?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor and Luke approached, murmuring, and Mrs
Montague went on, ‘I am to be in your most haunted room,
of course. Arthur can go anywhere. That blue suitcase is
mine, young man, and the small attaché case; they will go
in your most haunted room.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The nursery, I think,’ Dr Montague said when Luke
looked at him inquiringly. ‘I believe the nursery is one
source of disturbance,’ he told his wife, and she sighed
irritably.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It does seem to me that you could be more methodical,’
she said. ‘You’ve been here nearly a week and I suppose
you’ve done <span class="it">nothing</span> with planchette? Automatic writing?
I don’t imagine either of these young women has mediumistic
gifts? Those are Arthur’s bags right there. He brought
his golf clubs, just in case.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just in case of what?’ Theodora asked blankly, and Mrs
Montague turned to regard her coldly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Please don’t let me interrupt your dinner,’ she said finally.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There’s a definite cold spot just outside the nursery door,’
the doctor told his wife hopefully.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, dear, very nice. Isn’t that young man going to take
Arthur’s bags upstairs? You do seem to be in a good deal
of confusion here, don’t you? After nearly a week I certainly
thought you’d have things in some kind of order. Any figures
materialise?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There have been decided manifestations——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, I’m here now, and we’ll get things going right.
Where is Arthur to put the car?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There’s an empty stable in back of the house where we
have put our other cars. He can take it around in the
morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nonsense. I do not believe in putting things off, John, as
you know perfectly well. Arthur will have plenty to do in
the morning without adding tonight’s work. He must move
the car at once.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s dark outside,’ the doctor said hesitantly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘John, you astound me. Is it your belief that I do not
know whether it is dark outside at night? The car has lights,
John, and that young man can go with Arthur to show him
the way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you,’ said Luke grimly, ‘but we have a positive
policy against going outside after dark. Arthur may, of
course, if he cares to, but I will not.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The young ladies,’ the doctor said, ‘had a shocking——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Young man’s a coward,’ Arthur said. He had concluded
his fetching of suitcases and golf bags and hampers from
the car and now stood beside Mrs Montague, looking down
on Luke; Arthur’s face was red and his hair was white, and
now, scorning Luke, he bristled. ‘Ought to be ashamed of
yourself, fellow, in front of the women.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The women are just as much afraid as I am,’ Luke said
primly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Indeed, indeed.’ Dr Montague put his hand on Arthur’s
arm soothingly. ‘After you’ve been here for a while, Arthur,
you’ll understand that Luke’s attitude is sensible, not
cowardly. We make a point of staying together after dark.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I must say, John, I never expected to find you all so
<span class="it">nervous</span>,’ Mrs Montague said. ‘I deplore fear in these
matters.’ She tapped her foot irritably. ‘You know perfectly
well, John, that those who have passed beyond <span class="it">expect</span> to
see us happy and smiling; they <span class="it">want</span> to know that we are
thinking of them lovingly. The spirits dwelling in this house
may be actually <span class="it">suffering</span> because they are aware that you
are afraid of them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We can talk about it later,’ the doctor said wearily. ‘Now,
how about dinner?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course.’ Mrs Montague glanced at Theodora and
Eleanor. ‘What a pity that we had to interrupt you,’ she
said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Have you had dinner?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Naturally we have not had dinner, John. I <span class="it">said</span> we would
be here for dinner, didn’t I? Or am I mistaken again?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘At any rate, I told Mrs Dudley that you would be here,’
the doctor said, opening the door which led to the game
room and on into the dining-room. ‘She left us a splendid
feast.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Poor Dr Montague, Eleanor thought, standing aside to
let the doctor take his wife into the dining-room; he is so
uncomfortable; I wonder how long she is going to stay.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I wonder how long she is going to stay?’ Theodora
whispered in her ear.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Maybe her suitcase is filled with ectoplasm,’ Eleanor said
hopefully.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And how long will you be able to stay?’ Dr Montague
asked, sitting at the head of the dinner-table with his wife
cosily beside him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, dear,’ Mrs Montague said, tasting daintily of Mrs
Dudley’s caper sauce, ‘—you have found a fair cook, have
you not?—you <span class="it">know</span> that Arthur has to get back to his
school; Arthur is a headmaster,’ she explained down the
table, ‘and he has generously cancelled his appointments
for Monday. So we had better leave Monday afternoon and
then Arthur can be there for classes on Tuesday.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A lot of happy schoolboys Arthur no doubt left behind,’
Luke said softly to Theodora, and Theodora said, ‘But today
is only Saturday.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I do not mind this cooking at all,’ Mrs Montague said.
‘John, I will speak to your cook in the morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mrs Dudley is an admirable woman,’ the doctor said
carefully.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bit fancy for <span class="it">my</span> taste,’ Arthur said. ‘I’m a meat-and-potatoes
man, myself,’ he explained to Theodora. ‘Don’t
drink, don’t smoke, don’t read trash. Bad example for the
fellows at the school. They look up to one a bit, you know.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m sure they must all model themselves on you,’ Theodora
said soberly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Get a bad hat now and then,’ Arthur said, shaking his
head. ‘No taste for sports, you know. Moping in corners.
Cry-babies. Knock <span class="it">that</span> out of them fast enough.’ He reached
for the butter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Montague leaned forward to look down the table at
Arthur. ‘Eat lightly, Arthur,’ she advised. ‘We have a busy
night ahead of us.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What on earth do you plan to do?’ the doctor asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m sure that <span class="it">you</span> would never dream of going about these
things with any system, but you will have to admit, John,
that in this area I have simply more of an instinctive understanding;
women do, you know, John, at least <span class="it">some</span> women.’
She paused and regarded Eleanor and Theodora speculatively.
‘Neither of <span class="it">them</span>, I dare say. Unless, of course, I am
mistaken again? You are very fond of pointing out my errors,
John.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I <span class="it">cannot</span> abide a slipshod job in anything. Arthur will
patrol, of course. I brought Arthur for that purpose. It is
so rare,’ she explained to Luke, who sat on her other side,
’to find persons in the educational field who are interested
in the other world; you will find Arthur surprisingly well
informed. I will recline in your haunted room with only a
nightlight burning, and will endeavour to get in touch with
the elements disturbing this house. I never sleep when there
are troubled spirits about,’ she told Luke, who nodded,
speechless.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Little sound common sense,’ Arthur said. ‘Got to go about
these things in the right way. Never pays to aim too low.
Tell my fellows that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think perhaps after dinner we will have a little session
with planchette,’ Mrs Montague said. ‘Just Arthur and I, of
course; the rest of you, I can see, are not ready yet; you
would only drive away the spirits. We will need a quiet
room——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The library,’ Luke suggested politely.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The library? I think it might do; books are frequently
very good carriers, you know. Materialisations are often best
produced in rooms where there are books. I cannot think of
any time when materialisation was in any way hampered
by the presence of books. I suppose the library has been
dusted? Arthur sometimes sneezes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mrs Dudley keeps the entire house in perfect order,’ the
doctor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I really will speak to Mrs Dudley in the morning. You
will show us the library, then, John, and that young man
will bring down my case; not the large suitcase, mind, but
the small attaché case. Bring it to me in the library. We will
join you later; after a session with planchette I require a
glass of milk and perhaps a small cake; crackers will do
if they are not too heavily salted. A few minutes of quiet
conversation with congenial people is also very helpful,
particularly if I am to be receptive during the night; the
mind is a precise instrument and cannot be tended too carefully.
Arthur?’ She bowed distantly to Eleanor and Theodora
and went out, escorted by Arthur, Luke, and her husband.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a minute Theodora said, ‘I think I am going to be
simply crazy about Mrs Montague.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t know,’ Eleanor said. ‘Arthur is rather more to
my taste. And Luke <span class="it">is</span> a coward, I think.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Poor Luke,’ Theodora said. ‘He never had a mother.’
Looking up, Eleanor found that Theodora was regarding
her with a curious smile, and she moved away from the
table so quickly that a glass spilled.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We shouldn’t be alone,’ she said, oddly breathless. ‘We’ve
got to find the others.’ She left the table and almost ran
from the room, and Theodora ran after her, laughing, down
the corridor and into the little parlour, where Luke and the
doctor stood before the fire.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Please, sir,’ Luke was saying meekly, ‘who is planchette?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor sighed irritably. ‘Imbeciles,’ he said, and then,
‘Sorry. The whole idea annoys me, but if <span class="it">she</span> likes it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’
He turned and poked the fire furiously. ‘Planchette,’ he
went on after a moment, ‘is a device similar to the Ouija
Board, or perhaps I might explain better by saying that it
is a form of automatic writing; a method of communicating
with—ah—intangible beings, although to <span class="it">my</span> way of thinking
the only intangible beings who ever get in touch through
one of those things are the imaginations of the people running
it. Yes. Well. Planchette is a little piece of light wood,
usually heart-shaped or triangular. A pencil is set into the
narrow end, and at the other end is a pair of wheels, or feet
which will slip easily over paper. Two people place fingers
on it, ask it questions, and the object moves, pushed by what
force we will not here discuss, and writes answers. The
Ouija Board, as I say, is very similar, except that the object
moves on a board pointing to separate letters. An ordinary
wineglass will do the same thing; I have seen it tried with
a child’s wheeled toy, although I will admit that it looked
silly. Each person uses the tips of the fingers of one hand,
keeping the other hand free to note down questions and
answers. The answers are invariably, I believe, meaningless,
although of course my wife will tell you different. Balderdash.’
And he went at the fire again. ‘Schoolgirls,’ he said.
‘Superstition.’</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘Planchette has been very kind tonight,’ Mrs Montague
said. ‘John, there are definitely foreign elements present in
this house.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Quite a splendid sitting, really,’ Arthur said. He waved
a sheaf of papers triumphantly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ve got a good deal of information for you,’ Mrs Montague
said. ‘Now. Planchette was quite insistent about a
nun. Have you learned anything about a nun, John?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In Hill House? Not likely.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Planchette felt very strongly about a nun, John. Perhaps
something of the sort—a dark, vague figure, even—has been
seen in the neighbourhood? Villagers terrified when staggering
home late at night?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The figure of a nun is a fairly common——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘John, <span class="it">if</span> you please. I assume you are suggesting that I
am mistaken. Or perhaps it is your intention to point out
that <span class="it">planchette</span> may be mistaken? I assure you—and you
must believe planchette, even if <span class="it">my</span> word is not good enough
for you—that a nun was most specifically suggested.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am only trying to say, my dear, that the wraith of a
nun is far and away the most common form of appearance.
There has never been such a thing connected with Hill
House, but in almost every——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘John, <span class="it">if</span> you <span class="it">please</span>. I assume I may continue? Or is
planchette to be dismissed without a hearing? Thank you.’
Mrs Montague composed herself. ‘Now, then. There is also
a name, spelled variously as Helen, or Helene, or Elena.
Who might that be?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear, many people have lived——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Helen brought us a warning against a mysterious
monk. Now when a monk and a nun <span class="it">both</span> turn up in one
house——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Except the place was built on an older site,’ Arthur said.
‘Influences prevailing, you know. Older influences hanging
around,’ he explained more fully.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It sounds very much like broken vows, does it not? Very
much.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Had a lot of that back then, you know. Temptation,
probably.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hardly think——’ the doctor began.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I dare say she was walled up alive,’ Mrs Montague said.
‘The nun, I mean. They always did that, you know. You’ve
no idea the messages I’ve had from nuns walled up alive.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There is <span class="it">no</span> case on record of <span class="it">any</span> nun <span class="it">ever</span> being——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘John. May I point out to you once more that I <span class="it">myself</span>
have had messages from nuns walled up alive? Do you think
I am telling you a fib, John? Or do you suppose that a nun
would deliberately <span class="it">pretend</span> to have been walled up alive
when she was not? Is it possible that I am mistaken once
more, John?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Certainly not, my dear.’ Dr Montague sighed wearily.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘With one candle and a crust of bread,’ Arthur told Theodora.
‘Horrible thing to do, when you think about it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No nun was ever walled up alive,’ the doctor said sullenly.
He raised his voice slightly. ‘It is a legend. A story. A libel
circulated——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right, John. We won’t quarrel over it. You may believe
whatever you choose. Just understand, however, that sometimes
purely materialistic views must give way before <span class="it">facts</span>.
Now it is a proven fact that among the visitations troubling
this house are a nun and a——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What else was there?’ Luke asked hastily. ‘I am <span class="it">so</span> interested
in hearing what—ah—planchette had to say.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Montague waggled a finger roguishly. ‘Nothing about
<span class="it">you</span>, young man. Although one of the ladies present may
hear something of interest.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Impossible woman, Eleanor thought; impossible, vulgar,
possessive woman. ‘Now, Helen,’ Mrs Montague went on,
‘wants us to search the cellar for an old well.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t tell me <span class="it">Helen</span> was <span class="it">buried</span> alive,’ the doctor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hardly think so, John. I am sure that she would have
mentioned it. As a matter of fact, Helen was most unclear
about just what we <span class="it">were</span> to find in the well. I doubt, however,
that it will be treasure. One so rarely meets with <span class="it">real</span>
treasure in a case of this kind. More likely evidence of the
missing nun.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘More likely eighty years of rubbish.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘John, I can<span class="it">not</span> understand this scepticism in you, of all
people. After all, you did come to this house to collect evidence
of supernatural activity, and now, when I bring you
a full account of the <span class="it">causes</span>, and an indication of where to
start looking, you are positively scornful.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We have no authority to dig up the cellar.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Arthur could——’ Mrs Montague began hopefully, but
the doctor said with firmness, ‘No. My lease of the house
specifically forbids me to tamper with the house itself. There
will be no digging of cellars, no tearing out of woodwork,
no ripping up of floors. Hill House is still a valuable
property, and we are students, not vandals.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I should think you’d want to know the <span class="it">truth</span>, John.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There is nothing I should like to know more.’ Dr Montague
stamped across the room to the chessboard and took
up a knight and regarded it furiously. He looked as though
he were doggedly counting to a hundred.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Dear me, how patient one must be sometimes.’ Mrs
Montague sighed. ‘But I do want to read you the little
passage we received towards the end. Arthur, do you have
it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Arthur shuffled through his sheaf of papers. ‘It was just
after the message about the flowers you are to send to your
aunt,’ Mrs Montague said. ‘Planchette has a control named
Merrigot,’ she explained, ‘and Merrigot takes a genuine
personal interest in Arthur; brings him word from relatives,
and so on.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not a fatal illness, you understand,’ Arthur said gravely.
‘Have to send flowers, of course, but Merrigot is most
reassuring.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now.’ Mrs Montague selected several pages, and turned
them over quickly; they were covered with loose, sprawling
pencilled words, and Mrs Montague frowned, running down
the pages with her finger. ‘Here,’ she said. ‘Arthur, you read
the questions and I’ll read the answers; that way, it will
sound more natural.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Off we go,’ Arthur said brightly, and leaned over Mrs
Montague’s shoulder. ‘Now—let me see—start right about
here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘With “Who are you?” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Righto. Who are you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nell,’ Mrs Montague read in her sharp voice, and Eleanor
and Theodora and Luke and the doctor turned, listening.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nell who?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor Nellie Nell Nell. They sometimes do that,’ Mrs
Montague broke off to explain. ‘They repeat a word over
and over to make sure it comes across all right.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Arthur cleared his throat. ‘What do you want?’ he read.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Home.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Do you want to go home?’ And Theodora shrugged
comically at Eleanor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Want to be home.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What are you doing here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Waiting.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Waiting for what?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Home.’ Arthur stopped, and nodded profoundly. ‘There
it is again,’ he said. ‘Like a word, and use it over and over,
just for the sound of it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ordinarily we never ask <span class="it">why</span>,’ Mrs Montague said,
‘because it tends to confuse planchette. However, this time
we were bold, and came right out and asked. Arthur?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why?’ Arthur read.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mother,’ Mrs Montague read. ‘So you see, this time we
were right to ask, because planchette was perfectly free with
the answer.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is Hill House your home?’ Arthur read levelly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Home,’ Mrs Montague responded, and the doctor sighed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Are you suffering?’ Arthur read.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No answer here.’ Mrs Montague nodded reassuringly.
‘Sometimes they dislike admitting to pain; it tends to discourage
those of us left behind, you know. Just like Arthur’s
aunt, for instance, will <span class="it">never</span> let on that she is sick, but
Merrigot always lets us know, and it’s even worse when
they’ve passed over.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Stoical,’ Arthur confirmed, and read, ‘Can we help you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ Mrs Montague read.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Can we do anything at all for you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. Lost. Lost. Lost.’ Mrs Montague looked up. ‘You
see?’ she asked. ‘One word, over and over again. They <span class="it">love</span>
to repeat themselves. I’ve had one word go on to cover a
whole page sometimes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What do you want?’ Arthur read.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mother,’ Mrs Montague read back.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Child.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Where is your mother?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Home.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Where is your home?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Lost. Lost. Lost. And after that,’ Mrs Montague said,
folding the paper briskly, ‘there was nothing but gibberish.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Never</span> known planchette so co-operative,’ Arthur said confidingly
to Theodora. ‘Quite an experience, really.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But why pick on Nell?’ Theodora asked with annoyance.
‘Your fool planchette has no right to send messages to people
without permission or——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’ll never get results by abusing planchette,’ Arthur
began, but Mrs Montague interrupted him, swinging to stare
at Eleanor. ‘<span class="it">You</span>’re Nell?’ she demanded, and turned on
Theodora. ‘We thought <span class="it">you</span> were Nell,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So?’ said Theodora impudently.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It doesn’t affect the messages, of course,’ Mrs Montague
said, tapping her paper irritably, ‘although I <span class="it">do</span> think we
might have been correctly introduced. I am sure that
<span class="it">planchette</span> knew the difference between you, but I certainly
do not care to be misled.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t feel neglected,’ Luke said to Theodora. ‘We will
bury you alive.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘When I get a message from that thing,’ Theodora said,
‘I expect it to be about hidden treasure. None of this nonsense
about sending flowers to my aunt.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They are all carefully avoiding looking at me, Eleanor
thought; I have been singled out again, and they are kind
enough to pretend it is nothing; ‘Why do you think all that
was sent to me?’ she asked, helpless.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Really, child,’ Mrs Montague said, dropping the papers on
the low table, ‘I couldn’t <span class="it">begin</span> to say. Although you are
rather more than a child, aren’t you? Perhaps you are more
receptive psychically than you realise, although’—and she
turned away indifferently—‘how you <span class="it">could</span> be, a week in this
house and not picking up the simplest message from beyond
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That fire wants stirring.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nell doesn’t want messages from beyond,’ Theodora said
comfortingly, moving to take Eleanor’s cold hand in hers.
‘Nell wants her warm bed and a little sleep.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Peace, Eleanor thought concretely; what I want in all this
world is peace, a quiet spot to lie and think, a quiet spot
up among the flowers where I can dream and tell myself
sweet stories.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘I,’ Arthur said richly, ‘shall make my headquarters in the
small room just this side of the nursery, well within shouting
distance. I shall have with me a drawn revolver—do not take
alarm, ladies; I am an excellent shot—and a flashlight, in
addition to a most piercing whistle. I shall have no difficulty
summoning the rest of you in case I observe anything worth
your notice, or I require—ah—company. You may all sleep
quietly, I assure you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Arthur,’ Mrs Montague explained, ‘will patrol the house.
Every hour, regularly, he will make a round of the upstairs
rooms; I think he need hardly bother with the downstairs
rooms tonight, since <span class="it">I</span> shall be up here. We have done this
before, many times. Come along, everyone.’ Silently they
followed her up the staircase, watching her little affectionate
dabs at the stair-rail and the carvings on the walls. ‘It is such
a blessing,’ she said once, ‘to know that the beings in this
house are only waiting for an opportunity to tell their stories
and free themselves from the burden of their sorrow. Now.
Arthur will first of all inspect the bedrooms. Arthur?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘With apologies, ladies, with apologies,’ Arthur said, opening
the door of the blue room, which Eleanor and Theodora
shared. ‘A dainty spot,’ he said plummily, ‘fit for two such
charming ladies; I shall, if you like, save you the trouble of
glancing into the closet and under the bed.’ Solemnly they
watched Arthur go down on to his hands and knees and look
under the beds and then rise, dusting his hands. ‘Perfectly
safe,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now, where am I to be?’ Mrs Montague asked. ‘Where
did that young man put my bags?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Directly at the end of the hall,’ the doctor said. ‘We call
it the nursery.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Montague, followed by Arthur, moved purposefully
down the hall, passed the cold spot in the hall, and shivered.
‘I will certainly need extra blankets,’ she said. ‘Have that
young man bring extra blankets from one of the other
rooms.’ Opening the nursery door, she nodded and said, ‘The
bed looks quite fresh, I must admit, but has the room been
aired?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I told Mrs Dudley,’ the doctor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It smells musty. Arthur, you will have to open that
window, in spite of the cold.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Drearily the animals on the nursery wall looked down on
Mrs Montague. ‘Are you sure .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ The doctor hesitated, and
glanced up apprehensively at the grinning faces over the
nursery door. ‘I wonder if you ought to have someone in
here with you,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear.’ Mrs Montague, good-humoured now in the
presence of those who had passed beyond, was amused.
‘How many hours—how many, <span class="it">many</span> hours—have I sat in
purest love and understanding, alone in a room and yet
never alone? My dear, how can I make you perceive that
there is no danger where there is nothing but love and
sympathetic understanding? I am here to <span class="it">help</span> these unfortunate
beings—I am here to extend the hand of heartfelt
fondness, and let them know that there are still <span class="it">some</span> who
remember, who will listen and weep for them; their loneliness
is over, and I——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ the doctor said, ‘but leave the door open.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Unlocked, if you insist.’ Mrs Montague was positively
magnanimous.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I shall be only down the hall,’ the doctor said. ‘I can
hardly offer to patrol, since that will be Arthur’s occupation,
but if you need anything I can hear you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Montague laughed and waved her hand at him.
‘These others need your protection so much more than I,’
she said. ‘I will do what I can, of course. But they are so
very <span class="it">very</span> vulnerable, with their hard hearts and their unseeing
eyes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Arthur, followed by a Luke looking very much amused,
returned from checking the other bedrooms on the floor and
nodded briskly at the doctor. ‘All clear,’ he said. ‘Perfectly
safe for you to go to bed now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you,’ the doctor told him soberly and then said
to his wife, ‘Good night. Be careful.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good night,’ Mrs Montague said, and smiled around at
all of them. ‘Please don’t be afraid,’ she said. ‘No matter
what happens, remember that I am here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good night,’ Theodora said, and ‘Good night,’ said Luke,
and with Arthur behind them assuring them that they might
rest quietly, and not to worry if they heard shots, and he
would start his first patrol at midnight, Eleanor and Theodora
went into their own room, and Luke on down the hall
to his. After a moment the doctor, turning reluctantly away
from his wife’s closed door, followed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Wait,’ Theodora said to Eleanor, once in their room.
‘Luke said they want us down the hall; don’t get undressed
and be quiet.’ She opened the door a crack and whispered
over her shoulder. ‘I swear that old biddy’s going to blow
this house wide open with that perfect love business; if I
ever saw a place that had no use for perfect love, it’s Hill
House. Now. Arthur’s closed his door. Quick. Be quiet.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Silently, making no sound on the hall carpeting, they
hurried in their stockinged feet down the hall to the doctor’s
room. ‘Hurry,’ the doctor said, opening the door just wide
enough for them to come in, ‘be quiet.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s not safe,’ Luke said, closing the door to a crack and
coming back to sit on the floor, ‘that man’s going to shoot
somebody.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t like it,’ the doctor said, worried. ‘Luke and I will
stay up and watch, and I want you two ladies in here where
we can keep an eye on you. Something’s going to happen,’
he said. ‘I don’t like it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I just hope she didn’t go and make anything mad, with
her planchette,’ Theodora said. ‘Sorry, Doctor Montague. I
don’t intend to speak rudely of your wife.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor laughed, but stayed with his eye to the door.
‘She originally planned to come for our entire stay,’ he said,
‘but she had enrolled in a course in yoga and could not
miss her meetings. She is an excellent woman in most
respects,’ he added, looking earnestly around at them. ‘She
is a good wife, and takes very good care of me. She does
things splendidly, really. Buttons on my shirts.’ He smiled
hopefully. ‘This’—and he gestured in the direction of the
hall—‘<span class="it">this</span> is practically her only vice.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps she feels she is helping you with your work,’
Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor grimaced, and shivered; at that moment the
door swung wide and then crashed shut, and in the silence
outside they could hear slow rushing movements as though
a very steady, very strong wind were blowing the length of
the hall. Glancing at one another, they tried to smile, tried
to look courageous under the slow coming of the unreal
cold and then, through the noise of wind, the knocking on
the doors downstairs. Without a word Theodora took up
the quilt from the foot of the doctor’s bed and folded it
around Eleanor and herself, and they moved close together,
slowly in order not to make a sound. Eleanor, clinging to
Theodora, deadly cold in spite of Theodora’s arms around
her, thought, It knows my name, it knows my name this
time. The pounding came up the stairs, crashing on each
step. The doctor was tense, standing by the door, and Luke
moved over to stand beside him. ‘It’s nowhere near the
nursery,’ he said to the doctor, and put his hand out to stop
the doctor from opening the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How weary one gets of this constant pounding,’ Theodora
said ridiculously. ‘Next summer, I must really go somewhere
else.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There are disadvantages everywhere,’ Luke told her. ‘In
the lake regions you get mosquitoes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Could we have exhausted the repertoire of Hill House?’
Theodora asked, her voice shaking in spite of her light tone.
‘Seems like we’ve had this pounding act before; is it going
to start everything all over again?’ The crashing echoed
along the hall, seeming to come from the far end, the
farthest from the nursery, and the doctor, tense against the
door, shook his head anxiously. ‘I’m going to have to go
out there,’ he said. ‘She might be frightened,’ he told them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor, rocking to the pounding, which seemed inside
her head as much as in the hall, holding tight to Theodora,
said, ‘They know where we are,’ and the others, assuming
that she meant Arthur and Mrs Montague, nodded and
listened. The knocking, Eleanor told herself, pressing her
hands to her eyes and swaying with the noise, will go on
down the hall, it will go on and on to the end of the hall
and turn and come back again, it will just go on and on the
way it did before and then it will stop and we will look at
each other and laugh and try to remember how cold we
were, and the little swimming curls of fear on our backs;
after a while it will stop.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It will hurt <span class="it">us</span>,’ Theodora was telling the doctor, across
the noise of the pounding. ‘It won’t hurt <span class="it">them</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I only hope she doesn’t try to <span class="it">do</span> anything about it,’ the
doctor said grimly; he was still at the door, but seemingly
unable to open it against the volume of noise outside.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I feel positively like an old hand at this,’ Theodora said
to Eleanor. ‘Come closer, Nell; keep warm,’ and she pulled
Eleanor even nearer to her under the blanket, and the
sickening, still cold surrounded them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then there came, suddenly, quiet, and the secret creeping
silence they all remembered; holding their breaths, they
looked at one another. The doctor held the door-knob with
both hands, and Luke, although his face was white and his
voice trembled, said lightly, ‘Brandy, anyone? My passion
for spirits——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No.’ Theodora giggled wildly. ‘Not that pun,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sorry. You won’t believe me,’ Luke said, the brandy
decanter rattling against the glass as he tried to pour, ‘but
I no longer think of it as a pun. That is what living in a
haunted house does for a sense of humour.’ Using both
hands to carry the glass, he came to the bed where Theodora
and Eleanor huddled under the blanket, and Theodora
brought out one hand and took the glass. ‘Here,’ she said,
holding it to Eleanor’s mouth. ‘Drink.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sipping, not warmed, Eleanor thought, We are in the
eye of the storm; there is not much more time. She watched
Luke carefully carry a glass of brandy over to the doctor
and hold it out, and then, without comprehending, watched
the glass slip through Luke’s fingers to the floor as the door
was shaken, violently and silently. Luke pulled the doctor
back, and the door was attacked without sound, seeming
almost to be pulling away from its hinges, almost ready
to buckle and go down, leaving them exposed. Backing
away, Luke and the doctor waited, tense and helpless.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It can’t get in,’ Theodora was whispering over and over,
her eyes on the door, ‘it can’t get in, don’t let it get in, it
can’t get in——’ The shaking stopped, the door was quiet,
and a little caressing touch began on the door-knob, feeling
intimately and softly and then, because the door was locked,
patting and fondling the door-frame, as though wheedling
to be let in.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It knows we’re here,’ Eleanor whispered, and Luke, looking
back at her over his shoulder, gestured furiously for
her to be quiet.</p>

<p class="pindent">It is so cold, Eleanor thought childishly; I will never be
able to sleep again with all this noise coming from inside
my head; how can these others hear the noise when it is
coming from inside my head? I am disappearing inch by
inch into this house, I am going apart a little bit at a time
because all this noise is breaking me; why are the <span class="it">others</span>
frightened?</p>

<p class="pindent">She was aware, dully, that the pounding had begun again,
the metallic overwhelming sound of it washed over her like
waves; she put her cold hands to her mouth to feel if her
face was still there; I have had enough, she thought, I am
too cold.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘At the nursery door,’ Luke said tensely, speaking clearly
through the noise. ‘At the nursery door; don’t.’ And he put
out a hand to stop the doctor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Purest love,’ Theodora said madly, ‘purest love.’ And she
began to giggle again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If they don’t open the doors——’ Luke said to the doctor.
The doctor stood now with his head against the door, listening,
with Luke holding his arm to keep him from moving.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now we are going to have a new noise, Eleanor thought,
listening to the inside of her head; it is changing. The
pounding had stopped, as though it had proved ineffectual,
and there was now a swift movement up and down the hall,
as of an animal pacing back and forth with unbelievable
impatience, watching first one door and then another, alert
for a movement inside, and there was again the little babbling
murmur which Eleanor remembered; Am I doing it?
she wondered quickly, is that me? And heard the tiny
laughter beyond the door, mocking her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fe-fi-fo-fum,’ Theodora said under her breath, and the
laughter swelled and became a shouting; it’s inside my head,
Eleanor thought, putting her hands over her face, it’s inside
my head and it’s getting out, getting out, getting out——</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the house shivered and shook, the curtains dashing
against the windows, the furniture swaying, and the noise
in the hall became so great that it pushed against the walls;
they could hear breaking glass as the pictures in the hall
came down, and perhaps the smashing of windows. Luke
and the doctor strained against the door, as though desperately
holding it shut, and the floor moved under their
feet. We’re going, we’re going, Eleanor thought, and heard
Theodora say, far away, ‘The house is coming down.’ She
sounded calm, and beyond fear. Holding to the bed, buffeted
and shaken, Eleanor put her head down and closed her eyes
and bit her lips against the cold and felt the sickening
drop as the room fell away beneath her and then righted
itself and then turned, slowly, swinging. ‘God almighty,’
Theodora said, and a mile away at the door Luke caught
the doctor and held him upright.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Are you all right?’ Luke called, back braced against the
door, holding the doctor by the shoulders. ‘Theo, are you
all right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hanging on,’ Theodora said. ‘I don’t know about Nell.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Keep her warm,’ Luke said, far away. ‘We haven’t seen
it all yet.’ His voice trailed away; Eleanor could hear and
see him far away in the distant room where he and Theodora
and the doctor still waited; in the churning darkness
where she fell endlessly nothing was real except her own
hands white around the bedpost. She could see them, very
small, and see them tighten when the bed rocked and the
wall leaned forward and the door turned sideways far away.
Somewhere there was a great, shaking crash as some huge
thing came headlong; it must be the tower, Eleanor thought,
and I supposed it would stand for years; we are lost, lost;
the house is destroying itself. She heard the laughter over
all, coming thin and lunatic, rising in its little crazy tune,
and thought, No; it is over for me. It is too much, she
thought, I will relinquish my possession of this self of mine,
abdicate, give over willingly what I never wanted at all;
whatever it wants of me it can have.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll come,’ she said aloud, and was speaking up to Theodora,
who leaned over her. The room was perfectly quiet,
and between the still curtains at the window she could see
the sunlight. Luke sat in a chair by the window; his face
was bruised and his shirt was torn, and he was still drinking
brandy. The doctor sat back in another chair; his hair freshly
combed, looking neat and dapper and self-possessed. Theodora,
leaning over Eleanor, said, ‘She’s all right, I think,’ and
Eleanor sat up and shook her head, staring. Composed and
quiet, the house lifted itself primly around her, and nothing
had been moved.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ Eleanor said, and all three of them laughed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Another day,’ the doctor said, and in spite of his appearance
his voice was wan. ‘Another night,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘As I tried to say earlier,’ Luke remarked, ‘living in a
haunted house plays hell with a sense of humour; I really
did not intend to make a forbidden pun,’ he told Theodora.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How—are they?’ Eleanor asked, the words sounding unfamiliar
and her mouth stiff.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Both sleeping like babies,’ the doctor said. ‘Actually,’ he
said, as though continuing a conversation begun while
Eleanor slept, ‘I cannot believe that my wife stirred up that
storm, but I do admit that one more word about pure
love .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What happened?’ Eleanor asked; I must have been gritting
my teeth all night, she thought, the way my mouth
feels.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hill House went dancing,’ Theodora said, ‘taking us along
on a mad midnight fling. At least, I <span class="it">think</span> it was dancing;
it might have been turning somersaults.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s almost nine,’ the doctor said. ‘When Eleanor is
ready .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Come along, baby,’ Theodora said. ‘Theo will wash your
face for you and make you all neat for breakfast.’</p>

<h2><a name="chap08"></a>EIGHT</h2>

<p class="noindent">‘Did anyone tell them that Mrs Dudley clears at ten?’
Theodora looked into the coffee pot speculatively.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor hesitated. ‘I hate to wake them after such a
night.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But Mrs Dudley clears at ten.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They’re coming,’ Eleanor said. ‘I can hear them on the
stairs.’ I can hear everything, all over the house, she wanted
to tell them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then, distantly, they could all hear Mrs Montague’s voice,
raised in irritation and Luke, realising, said, ‘Oh, Lord—they
can’t find the dining-room,’ and hurried out to open
doors.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘—properly aired.’ Mrs Montague’s voice preceded her,
and she swept into the dining-room, tapped the doctor curtly
on the shoulder by way of greeting and seated herself with
a general nod to the others. ‘I must say,’ she began at once,
’that I think you might have called us for breakfast. I suppose
everything is cold? Is the coffee bearable?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good morning,’ Arthur said sulkily, and sat down himself
with an air of sullen ill temper. Theodora almost upset the
coffee pot in her haste to set a cup of coffee before Mrs
Montague.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It <span class="it">seems</span> hot enough,’ Mrs Montague said. ‘I shall speak
to your Mrs Dudley this morning in any case. That room
must be aired.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And your night?’ the doctor asked timidly. ‘Did you
spend a—ah—profitable night?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If by profitable you meant comfortable, John, I wish
you would say so. No, in answer to your most civil inquiry,
I did <span class="it">not</span> spend a comfortable night. I did not sleep a wink.
That room is unendurable.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Noisy old house, isn’t it?’ Arthur said. ‘Branch kept tapping
against my window all night; nearly drove me crazy,
tapping and tapping.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Even with the windows open that room is stuffy. Mrs
Dudley’s coffee is not as poor as her housekeeping. Another
cup, if you please. I am astonished, John, that you put me
in a room not properly aired; if there is to be any communication
with those beyond, the air circulation, at least, ought
to be adequate. I smelled dust all night.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Can’t understand <span class="it">you</span>,’ Arthur said to the doctor, ‘letting
yourself get all nervy about this place. Sat there all night
long with my revolver and not a mouse stirred. Except for
that infernal branch tapping on the window. Nearly drove
me crazy,’ he confided to Theodora.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We will not give up hope, of course.’ Mrs Montague
scowled at her husband. ‘Perhaps tonight there may be
some manifestations.’</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘Theo?’ Eleanor put down her notepad, and Theodora,
scribbling busily, looked up with a frown. ‘I’ve been thinking
about something.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I <span class="it">hate</span> writing these notes; I feel like a damn fool trying
to write this crazy stuff.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve been wondering.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well?’ Theodora smiled a little. ‘You look so serious,’ she
said. ‘Are you coming to some great decision?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ Eleanor said, deciding. ‘About what I’m going to do
afterwards. After we all leave Hill House.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m coming with you,’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Coming where with me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Back with you, back home. I’—and Eleanor smiled wryly—‘am
going to follow you home.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora stared. ‘Why?’ she asked blankly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I never had anyone to care about,’ Eleanor said, wondering
where she had heard someone say something like this
before. ‘I want to be some place where I belong.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am not in the habit of taking home stray cats,’ Theodora
said lightly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor laughed too. ‘I <span class="it">am</span> a kind of stray cat, aren’t I?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well.’ Theodora took up her pencil again. ‘You have your
own home,’ she said. ‘You’ll be glad enough to get back
to it when the time comes, Nell my Nellie. I suppose we’ll
all be glad to get back home. What are you saying about
those noises last night? <span class="it">I</span> can’t describe them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll come, you know,’ Eleanor said. ‘I’ll just come.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nellie, Nellie.’ Theodora laughed again. ‘Look,’ she said.
‘This is just a summer, just a few weeks’ visit to a lovely
old summer resort in the country. You have your life back
home, I have <span class="it">my</span> life. When the summer is over, we go back.
We’ll write each other, of course, and maybe visit, but Hill
House is not for ever, you know.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I can get a job; I won’t be in your way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t understand.’ Theodora threw down her pencil in
exasperation. ‘Do you <span class="it">always</span> go where you’re not wanted?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor smiled placidly. ‘I’ve never been wanted <span class="it">anywhere</span>,’
she said.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s all so motherly,’ Luke said. ‘Everything so soft. Everything
so padded. Great embracing chairs and sofas which
turn out to be hard and unwelcoming when you sit down,
and reject you at once——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Theo?’ Eleanor said softly, and Theodora looked at her
and shook her head in bewilderment.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘—and hands everywhere. Little soft glass hands, curving
out to you, beckoning——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Theo?’ Eleanor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ Theodora said. ‘I won’t have you. And I don’t want
to talk about it any more.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps,’ Luke said, watching them, ‘the single most repulsive
aspect is the emphasis upon the globe. I ask you to
regard impartially the lampshade made of tiny pieces of
broken glass glued together, or the great round balls of the
lights upon the stairs or the fluted iridescent candy jar at
Theo’s elbow. In the dining-room there is a bowl of particularly
filthy yellow glass resting upon the cupped hands of a
child, and an Easter egg of sugar with a vision of shepherds
dancing inside. A bosomy lady supports the stair-rail on her
head, and under glass in the drawing-room——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nellie, leave me alone. Let’s walk down to the brook or
something.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘—a child’s face, done in cross-stitch. Nell, don’t look so
apprehensive; Theo has only suggested that you walk down
to the brook. If you like, I will go along.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Anything,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘To frighten away rabbits. If you like, I will carry a stick.
If you like, I will not come at all. Theo has only to say the
word.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora laughed. ‘Perhaps Nell would rather stay here
and write on walls.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So unkind,’ Luke said. ‘Callous of you, Theo.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I want to hear more about the shepherds dancing in the
Easter egg,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A world contained in sugar. Six very tiny shepherds
dancing, and a shepherdess in pink and blue reclining upon
a mossy bank enjoying them; there are flowers and trees
and sheep, and an old goatherd playing pipes. I would like
to have been a goatherd, I think.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If you were not a bullfighter,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If I were not a bullfighter. Nell’s affairs are the talk of
the cafés, you will recall.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Pan,’ Theodora said. ‘You should live in a hollow tree,
Luke.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nell,’ Luke said, ‘you are not listening.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think you frighten her, Luke.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Because Hill House will be mine some day, with its untold
treasures and its cushions? I am not gentle with a house,
Nell; I might take a fit of restlessness and smash the sugar
Easter egg, or shatter the little child hands or go stomping
and shouting up and down the stairs striking at glued-glass
lamps with a cane and slashing at the bosomy lady with
the staircase on her head; I might——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You see? You do frighten her.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I believe I do,’ Luke said. ‘Nell, I am <span class="it">only</span> talking nonsense.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t think he even owns a cane,’ Theodora said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘As a matter of fact, I do. Nell, I am <span class="it">only</span> talking nonsense.
What is she thinking about, Theo?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora said carefully, ‘She wants me to take her home
with me after we leave Hill House, and I won’t do it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Luke laughed. ‘Poor silly Nell,’ he said. ‘Journeys end in
lovers meeting. Let’s go down to the brook.’</p>

<p class="line">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A mother house,’ Luke said, as they came down the steps
from the verandah to the lawn, ‘a housemother, a headmistress,
a housemistress. I am sure I will be a very poor
housemaster, like our Arthur, when Hill House belongs to
me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I can’t understand anyone wanting to own Hill House,’
Theodora said, and Luke turned and looked back with
amusement at the house.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You never know what you are going to want until you
see it clearly,’ he said. ‘If I never had a chance of owning it
I might feel very differently. What do people really want
with each other, as Nell asked me once; what use are other
people?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was my fault my mother died,’ Eleanor said. ‘She
knocked on the wall and called me and called me and I
never woke up. I ought to have brought her the medicine;
I always did before. But this time she called me and I never
woke up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You should have forgotten all that by now,’ Theodora
said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve wondered ever since if I did wake up. If I did wake
up and hear her, and if I just went back to sleep. It would
have been easy, and I’ve wondered about it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Turn here,’ Luke said. ‘If we’re going to the brook.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You worry too much, Nell. You probably just <span class="it">like</span> thinking
it was your fault.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was going to happen sooner or later, in any case,’
Eleanor said. ‘But of course no matter when it happened,
it was going to be my fault.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If it hadn’t happened you would never have come to
Hill House.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We go single file along here,’ Luke said. ‘Nell, go first.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Smiling, Eleanor went on ahead, kicking her feet comfortably
along the path. Now I know where I am going,
she thought; I told her about my mother so <span class="it">that’s</span> all right; I
will find a little house, or maybe an apartment like hers. I
will see her every day, and we will go searching together
for lovely things—gold-rimmed dishes, and a white cat,
and a sugar Easter egg, and a cup of stars. I will not be
frightened or alone any more; I will call myself just <span class="it">Eleanor</span>.
‘Are you two talking about me?’ she asked over her shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a minute Luke answered politely. ‘A struggle between
good and evil for the soul of Nell. I suppose I will
have to be God, however.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But of course she can<span class="it">not</span> trust either of us,’ Theodora said,
amused.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not me, certainly,’ Luke said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Besides, Nell,’ Theodora said, ‘we were not talking about
you at all. As though I were the games mistress,’ she said,
half angry, to Luke.</p>

<p class="pindent">I have waited such a long time, Eleanor was thinking; I
have finally earned my happiness. She came, leading them,
to the top of the hill and looked down to the slim line of
trees they must pass through to get to the brook. They are
lovely against the sky, she thought, so straight and free;
Luke was wrong about the softness everywhere, because
the trees are hard like wooden trees. They are still talking
about me, talking about how I came to Hill House and
found Theodora and now I will not let her go. Behind her
she could hear the murmur of their voices, edged sometimes
with malice, sometimes rising in mockery, sometimes
touched with a laughter almost of kinship, and she walked
on dreamily, hearing them come behind. She could tell
when they entered the tall grass a minute after she did,
because the grass moved hissingly beneath their feet and a
startled grasshopper leaped wildly away.</p>

<p class="pindent">I could help her in her shop, Eleanor thought; she loves
beautiful things and I would go with her to find them. We
could go anywhere we pleased, to the edge of the world if
we liked, and come back when we wanted to. He is telling
her now what he knows about me: that I am not easily
taken in, that I had an oleander wall around me, and she
is laughing because I am not going to be lonely any more.
They are very much alike and they are very kind; I would
not really have expected as much from them as they are
giving me; I was very right to come because journeys end
in lovers meeting.</p>

<p class="pindent">She came under the hard branches of the trees and the
shadows were pleasantly cool after the hot sun on the path;
now she had to walk more carefully because the path led
downhill and there were sometimes rocks and roots across
her way. Behind her their voices went on, quick and sharp,
and then more slowly and laughing; I will not look back,
she thought happily, because then they would know what
I am thinking; we will talk about it together some day, Theo
and I, when we have plenty of time. How strange I feel,
she thought, coming out of the trees on to the last steep
part of the path going down to the brook; I am caught in
a kind of wonder, I am still with joy. I will not look around
until I am next to the brook, where she almost fell the day
we came; I will remind her about the golden fish in the
brook and about our picnic.</p>

<p class="pindent">She sat down on the narrow green bank and put her chin
on her knees; I will not forget this one moment in my life,
she promised herself, listening to their voices and their footsteps
coming slowly down the hill. ‘Hurry up,’ she said,
turning her head to look for Theodora. ‘I——’ and was silent.
There was no one on the hill, nothing but the footsteps
coming clearly along the path and the faint mocking
laughter.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Who——?’ she whispered. ‘Who?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She could see the grass go down under the weight of the
footsteps. She saw another grasshopper leap wildly away,
and a pebble jar and roll. She heard clearly the brush of
footsteps on the path and then, standing back hard against
the bank, heard the laughter very close; ‘Eleanor, Eleanor,’
and she heard it inside and outside her head; this was a
call she had been listening for all her life. The footsteps
stopped and she was caught in a movement of air so solid
that she staggered and was held. ‘Eleanor, Eleanor,’ she
heard through the rushing of air past her ears, ‘Eleanor,
Eleanor,’ and she was held tight and safe. It is not cold
at all, she thought, it is not cold at all. She closed her eyes
and leaned back against the bank and thought, Don’t let
me go, and then, Stay, stay, as the firmness which held her
slipped away, leaving her and fading; ‘Eleanor, Eleanor,’
she heard once more and then she stood beside the brook,
shivering as though the sun had gone, watching without
surprise the vacant footsteps move across the water of the
brook, sending small ripples going, and then over on to the
grass on the other side, moving slowly and caressingly up
and over the hill.</p>

<p class="pindent">Come back, she almost said, standing shaking by the
brook, and then she turned and ran madly up the hill, crying
as she ran and calling, ‘Theo? Luke?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She found them in the little group of trees, leaning against
a tree trunk and talking softly and laughing; when she ran
to them they turned, startled, and Theodora was almost
angry. ‘What on earth do you want this time?’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I waited for you by the brook——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We decided to stay here where it was cool,’ Theodora
said. ‘We thought you heard us calling you. Didn’t we,
Luke?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, yes,’ said Luke, embarrassed. ‘We were sure you
heard us calling.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Anyway,’ Theodora said, ‘we were going to come along
in a minute. Weren’t we, Luke?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Luke, grinning. ‘Oh, yes.’</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘Subterranean waters,’ the doctor said, waving his fork.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nonsense. Does Mrs Dudley do all your cooking? The
asparagus is more than passable. Arthur, let that young man
help you to asparagus.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear.’ The doctor looked fondly upon his wife. ‘It has
become our custom to rest for an hour or so after lunch;
if you——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Certainly not. I have far too much to do while I am here.
I must speak to your cook, I must see that my room is
aired, I must ready planchette for another session this
evening; Arthur must clean his revolver.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mark of a fighting man,’ Arthur conceded. ‘Firearms
always in good order.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">You</span> and <span class="it">these</span> young people may rest, of course. Perhaps
you do not feel the urgency which I do, the terrible compulsion
to aid whatever poor souls wander restlessly here;
perhaps you find me foolish in my sympathy for them,
perhaps I am even ludicrous in your eyes because I can
spare a tear for a lost abandoned soul, left without any
helping hand; pure love——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Croquet?’ Luke said hastily. ‘Croquet, perhaps?’ He
looked eagerly from one to another. ‘Badminton?’ he suggested.
‘Croquet?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Subterranean waters?’ Theodora added helpfully.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No fancy sauces for <span class="it">me</span>,’ Arthur said firmly. ‘Tell my
fellows it’s the mark of a cad.’ He looked thoughtfully at
Luke. ‘Mark of a cad. Fancy sauces, women waiting on you.
<span class="it">My</span> fellows wait on themselves. Mark of a man,’ he said to
Theodora.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And what else do you teach them?’ Theodora asked
politely.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Teach? You mean—do they learn anything, my fellows?
You mean—algebra, like? Latin? Certainly.’ Arthur sat back,
pleased. ‘Leave all that kind of thing to the teachers,’ he
explained.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And how many fellows are there in your school?’ Theodora
leaned forward, courteous, interested, making conversation
with a guest, and Arthur basked; at the head of the
table Mrs Montague frowned and tapped her fingers impatiently.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How many? How many. Got a crack tennis team, you
know.’ He beamed on Theodora. ‘Crack. Absolutely tophole.
Not counting milksops?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not counting,’ said Theodora, ‘milksops.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh. Tennis. Golf. Baseball. Track. Cricket.’ He smiled
slyly. ‘Didn’t guess we played cricket, did you? Then there’s
swimming, and volleyball. Some fellows go out for everything,
though,’ he told her anxiously. ‘All-around types.
Maybe seventy, altogether.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Arthur?’ Mrs Montague could contain herself no longer.
‘No shop talk, now. You’re on vacation, remember.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, silly of me.’ Arthur smiled fondly. ‘Got to check the
weapons,’ he explained.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s two o’clock,’ Mrs Dudley said in the doorway. ‘I clear
off at two.’</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class="pindent">Theodora laughed, and Eleanor, hidden deep in the
shadows behind the summerhouse, put her hands over her
mouth to keep from speaking to let them know she was
there; I’ve got to find out, she was thinking, I’ve got to find
out.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s called “The Grattan Murders,” ’ Luke was saying.
‘Lovely thing. I can even sing it if you prefer.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mark of a cad.’ Theodora laughed again. ‘Poor Luke; I
would have said “scoundrel.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If you would rather be spending this brief hour with
Arthur .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course I would rather be with Arthur. An educated
man is always an enlivening companion.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Cricket,’ Luke said. ‘Never would have thought we
played cricket, would you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sing, sing,’ Theodora said, laughing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Luke sang, in a nasal monotone, emphasising each word
distinctly:</p>

<p class="pindent">When he finished there was a moment’s silence, and then
Theodora said weakly, ‘It’s lovely, Luke. Perfectly beautiful.
I will never hear it again without thinking of you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I plan to sing it to Arthur,’ Luke said. When are they
going to talk about me? Eleanor wondered in the shadows.
After a minute Luke went on idly, ‘I wonder what the
doctor’s book will be like, when he writes it? Do you suppose
he’ll put us in?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You will probably turn up as an earnest young psychic
researcher. And I will be a lady of undeniable gifts but
dubious reputation.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I wonder if Mrs Montague will have a chapter to herself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And Arthur. And Mrs Dudley. I hope he doesn’t reduce
us all to figures on a graph.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I wonder, I wonder,’ said Luke. ‘It’s warm this afternoon,’
he said. ‘What could we do that is cool?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We could ask Mrs Dudley to make lemonade.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You know what I want to do?’ Luke said. ‘I want to
explore. Let’s follow the brook up into the hills and see
where it comes from; maybe there’s a pond somewhere and
we can go swimming.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Or a waterfall; it looks like a brook that runs naturally
from a waterfall.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Come on, then.’ Listening behind the summerhouse,
Eleanor heard their laughter and the sound of their feet
running down the path to the house.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘Here’s an interesting thing, here,’ Arthur’s voice said in
the manner of one endeavouring valiantly to entertain, ‘here
in this book. Says how to make candles out of ordinary
children’s crayons.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Interesting.’ The doctor sounded weary. ‘If you will
excuse me, Arthur, I have all these notes to write up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sure, Doctor. All got our work to do. Not a sound.’
Eleanor, listening outside the parlour door, heard the small
irritating noises of Arthur settling down to be quiet. ‘Not
much to do around here, is there?’ Arthur said. ‘How d’you
pass the time generally?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Working,’ the doctor said shortly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You writing down what happens in the house?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You got me in there?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Seems like you ought to put in our notes from planchette.
What are you writing now?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Arthur. Can you read, or something?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sure. Never meant to make a nuisance of myself.’ Eleanor
heard Arthur take up a book, and put it down, and light a
cigarette, and sigh, and stir, and finally say, ‘Listen, isn’t
there anything to <span class="it">do</span> around here? Where <span class="it">is</span> everybody?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor spoke patiently, but without interest. ‘Theodora
and Luke have gone to explore the brook, I think. And
I suppose the others are around somewhere. As a matter of
fact, I believe my wife was looking for Mrs Dudley.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh.’ Arthur sighed again. ‘Might as well read, I guess,’
he said, and then, after a minute, ‘Say, Doctor. I don’t like
to bother you, but listen to what it says here in this
book.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ Mrs Montague said, ‘I do <span class="it">not</span> believe in throwing
young people together promiscuously, Mrs Dudley. If my
husband had consulted <span class="it">me</span> before arranging this fantastic
house party——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, now.’ It was Mrs Dudley’s voice, and Eleanor,
pressed against the dining-room door, stared and opened her
mouth wide against the wooden panels of the door. ‘I always
say, Mrs Montague, that you’re only young once. Those
young people are enjoying themselves, and it’s only natural
for the young.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But living under one roof——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s not as though they weren’t grown up enough to know
right from wrong. That pretty Theodora lady is old enough
to take care of herself, I’d think, no matter how gay Mr
Luke.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I need a dry dish-towel, Mrs Dudley, for the silverware.
It’s a shame, I think, the way children grow up these days
knowing everything. There should be more mysteries for
them, more things that belong rightly to grown-ups, that
they have to wait to find out.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then they find them out the hard way.’ Mrs Dudley’s
voice was comfortable and easy. ‘Dudley brought in these
tomatoes from the garden this morning,’ she said. ‘They did
well this year.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Shall I start on them?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, oh, no. You sit down over there and rest; you’ve done
enough. I’ll put on the water and we’ll have a nice cup of
tea.’</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p class="pindent">‘Journeys end in lovers meeting,’ Luke said, and smiled
across the room at Eleanor. ‘Does that blue dress on Theo
really belong to you? I’ve never seen it before.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am Eleanor,’ Theodora said wickedly, ‘because I have
a beard.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You were wise to bring clothes for two,’ Luke told
Eleanor. ‘Theo would never have looked half so well in my
old blazer.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am Eleanor,’ Theo said, ‘because I am wearing blue.
I love my love with an E because she is ethereal. Her name
is Eleanor, and she lives in expectation.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She is being spiteful, Eleanor thought remotely; from a
great distance, it seemed, she could watch these people and
listen to them. Now she thought, Theo is being spiteful and
Luke is trying to be nice; Luke is ashamed of himself for
laughing at me and he is ashamed of Theo for being spiteful.
‘Luke,’ Theodora said, with a half-glance at Eleanor, ‘come
and sing to me again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Later,’ Luke said uncomfortably. ‘The doctor has just set
up the chessmen.’ He turned away in some haste.</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora, piqued, leaned her head against the back of
her chair and closed her eyes, clearly determined not to
speak. Eleanor sat, looking down at her hands, and listened
to the sounds of the house. Somewhere upstairs a door
swung quietly shut; a bird touched the tower briefly and
flew off. In the kitchen the stove was settling and cooling, with
little soft creakings. An animal—a rabbit?—moved through
the bushes by the summerhouse. She could even hear, with
her new awareness of the house, the dust drifting gently
in the attics, the wood ageing. Only the library was closed
to her; she could not hear the heavy breathing of Mrs
Montague and Arthur over their planchette, nor their little
excited questions; she could not hear the books rotting or
rust seeping into the circular iron stairway to the tower. In
the little parlour she could hear, without raising her eyes,
Theodora’s small irritated tappings and the quiet sound of
the chessmen being set down. She heard when the library
door slammed open, and then the sharp angry sound of
footsteps coming to the little parlour, and then all of them
turned as Mrs Montague opened the door and marched in.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I must say,’ said Mrs Montague on a sharp, explosive
breath, ‘I really must <span class="it">say</span> that this is the most <span class="it">infuriating</span>——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear.’ The doctor rose, but Mrs Montague waved him
aside angrily. ‘If you had the <span class="it">decency</span>——’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Arthur, coming behind her sheepishly, moved past her
and, almost slinking, settled in a chair by the fire. He shook
his head warily when Theodora turned to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The common <span class="it">decency</span>. After all, John, I <span class="it">did</span> come all this
way, and so did Arthur, just to help out, and I certainly
must say that I never expected to meet with such cynicism
and incredulity from <span class="it">you</span>, of all people, and <span class="it">these</span>——’ She
gestured at Eleanor and Theodora and Luke. ‘All I ask,
all I <span class="it">ask</span>, is some small minimum of trust, just a little bit of
sympathy for all I am trying to do, and instead you disbelieve,
you scoff, you mock and jeer.’ Breathing heavily,
red-faced, she shook her finger at the doctor. Planchette,’
she said bitterly, ‘will not speak to me tonight. Not <span class="it">one single
word</span> have I had from planchette, as a direct result of your
sneering and your scepticism; planchette may very possibly
not speak to me for a matter of weeks—it has happened
before, I can tell you; it has happened before, when I subjected
it to the taunts of unbelievers; I have known planchette
to be silent for weeks, and the very <span class="it">least</span> I could
have expected, coming here as I did with none but the finest
motives, was a little respect.’ She shook her finger at the
doctor, wordless for the moment.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear,’ the doctor said, ‘I am certain that none of
us would knowingly have interfered.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mocking and jeering, were you not? Sceptical, with
planchette’s very words before your eyes? Those young
people pert and insolent?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mrs Montague, really .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ said Luke, but Mrs Montague
brushed past him and sat herself down, her lips tight and
her eyes blazing. The doctor sighed, started to speak, and
then stopped. Turning away from his wife, he gestured Luke
back to the chess table. Apprehensively, Luke followed, and
Arthur, wriggling in his chair, said in a low voice to Theodora,
‘Never seen her so upset, you know. Miserable experience,
waiting for planchette. So easily offended, of
course. Sensitive to atmosphere.’ Seeming to believe that he
had satisfactorily explained the situation, he sat back and
smiled timidly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor was hardly listening, wondering dimly at the
movement in the room. Someone was walking around, she
thought without interest; Luke was walking back and forth
in the room, talking softly to himself; surely an odd way
to play chess? Humming? Singing? Once or twice she almost
made out a broken word, and then Luke spoke quietly; he
was at the chess table where he belonged, and Eleanor
turned and looked at the empty centre of the room, where
someone was walking and singing softly, and then she heard
it clearly:</p>

<p class="noindent">Why, I know that, she thought, listening, smiling, to the
faint melody; we used to play that game; I remember that.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s simply that it’s a most delicate and intricate piece of
machinery,’ Mrs Montague was saying to Theodora; she was
still angry, but visibly softening under Theodora’s sympathetic
attention. ‘The slightest air of disbelief offends it,
naturally. How would <span class="it">you</span> feel if people refused to believe
in <span class="it">you</span>?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice was light, perhaps only a child’s voice, singing
sweetly and thinly, on the barest breath, and Eleanor smiled
and remembered, hearing the little song more clearly than
Mrs Montague’s voice continuing about planchette.</p>

<p class="pindent">She heard the little melody fade, and felt the slight movement
of air as the footsteps came close to her, and something
almost brushed her face; perhaps there was a tiny sigh
against her cheek, and she turned in surprise. Luke and the
doctor bent over the chessboard, Arthur leaned confidingly
close to Theodora, and Mrs Montague talked.</p>

<p class="pindent">None of them heard it, she thought with joy; nobody
heard it but me.</p>

<h2><a name="chap09"></a>NINE</h2>

<p class="noindent">Eleanor closed the bedroom door softly behind her, not
wanting to awaken Theodora, although the noise of a door
closing would hardly disturb anyone, she thought, who
slept so soundly as Theodora; I learned to sleep very lightly,
she told herself comfortingly, when I was listening for my
mother. The hall was dim, lighted only by the small nightlight
over the stairs, and all the doors were closed. Funny,
Eleanor thought, going soundlessly on her bare feet along
the hall carpet, it’s the only house I ever knew where you
don’t have to worry about making noise at night, or at least
about anyone knowing it’s you. She had awakened with
the thought of going down to the library, and her mind had
supplied her with a reason: I cannot sleep, she explained
to herself, and so I am going downstairs to get a book. If
anyone asks me where I am going, it is down to the library
to get a book because I cannot sleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was warm, drowsily, luxuriously warm. She went barefoot
and in silence down the great staircase and to the
library door before she thought, But I can’t go in there; I’m
not allowed in there—and recoiled in the doorway before
the odour of decay, which nauseated her. ‘Mother,’ she said
aloud, and stepped quickly back. ‘Come along,’ a voice
answered distinctly upstairs, and Eleanor turned, eager,
and hurried to the staircase. ‘Mother?’ she said softly, and
then again, ‘Mother?’ A little soft laugh floated down to
her, and she ran, breathless, up the stairs and stopped at the
top, looking to right and left along the hallway at the closed
doors.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re here somewhere,’ she said, and down the hall the
little echo went, slipping in a whisper on the tiny currents
of air. ‘Somewhere,’ it said. ‘Somewhere.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Laughing, Eleanor followed, running soundlessly down
the hall to the nursery doorway; the cold spot was gone,
and she laughed up at the two grinning faces looking
down at her. ‘Are you in here?’ she whispered outside the
door, ‘are you in here?’ and knocked, pounding with her
fists.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes?’ It was Mrs Montague, inside, clearly just awakened.
‘Yes? Come in, whatever you are.’</p>

<p class="pindent">No, no, Eleanor thought, hugging herself and laughing
silently, not in there, not with Mrs Montague, and slipped
away down the hall, hearing Mrs Montague behind her
calling, ‘I am your friend; I intend you no harm. Come in
and tell me what is troubling you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She won’t open her door, Eleanor thought wisely; she is
not afraid but she won’t open the door, and knocked, pounding,
against Arthur’s door and heard Arthur’s awakening
gasp.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dancing, the carpet soft under her feet, she came to the
door behind which Theodora slept; faithless Theo, she
thought, cruel, laughing Theo, wake up, wake up, wake up,
and pounded and slapped the door, laughing, and shook
the door-knob and then ran swiftly down the hall to Luke’s
door and pounded; wake up, she thought, wake up and be
faithless. None of them will open their doors, she thought;
they will sit inside, with the blankets pressed around them,
shivering and wondering what is going to happen to them
next; wake up, she thought, pounding on the doctor’s door;
I dare you to open your door and come out to see me
dancing in the hall of Hill House.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then Theodora startled her by calling out wildly, ‘Nell?
Nell? Doctor, Luke, Nell’s not here!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Poor house, Eleanor thought, I had forgotten Eleanor;
now they will have to open their doors, and she ran quickly
down the stairs, hearing behind her the doctor’s voice raised
anxiously, and Theodora calling, ‘Nell? Eleanor?’ What fools
they are, she thought; now I will have to go into the library.
‘Mother, Mother,’ she whispered, ‘Mother,’ and stopped at
the library door, sick. Behind her she could hear them talking
upstairs in the hall; funny, she thought, I can feel the
whole house, and heard even Mrs Montague protesting, and
Arthur, and then the doctor, clearly, ‘We’ve got to look for
her; everyone please hurry.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, I can hurry too, she thought, and ran down the
corridor to the little parlour, where the fire flickered briefly
at her when she opened the door, and the chessmen sat
where Luke and the doctor had left their game. The scarf
Theodora had been wearing lay across the back of her chair;
I can take care of <span class="it">that</span> too, Eleanor thought, her maid’s
pathetic finery, and put one end of it between her teeth
and pulled, tearing, and then dropped it when she heard
them behind her on the stairs. They were coming down all
together, anxious, telling one another where to look first,
now and then calling, ‘Eleanor? Nell?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Coming? Coming?’ she heard far away, somewhere else
in the house, and she heard the stairs shake under their
feet and a cricket stir on the lawn. Daring, gay, she ran
down the corridor again to the hall and peeked out at them
from the doorway. They were moving purposefully, all together,
straining to stay near one another, and the doctor’s
flashlight swept the hall and stopped at the great front door,
which was standing open wide. Then, in a rush, calling
‘Eleanor, <span class="it">Eleanor</span>,’ they ran all together across the hall and
out of the front door, looking and calling, the flashlight moving
busily. Eleanor clung to the door and laughed until tears
came into her eyes; what fools they are, she thought; we
trick them so easily. They are so slow, and so deaf and so
<span class="it">heavy</span>; they trample over the house, poking and peering
and rough. She ran across the hall and through the game
room and into the dining-room and from there into the
kitchen, with its doors. It’s good here, she thought, I can
go in any direction when I hear them. When they came
back into the front hall, blundering and calling her, she
darted quickly out on to the verandah into the cool night.
She stood with her back against the door, the little mists of
Hill House curling around her ankles, and looked up at
the pressing, heavy hills. Gathered comfortably into the hills,
she thought, protected and warm; Hill House is lucky.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor?’ They were very close, and she ran along the
verandah and darted into the drawing-room; ‘Hugh Crain,’
she said, ‘will you come and dance with me?’ She curtsied
to the huge leaning statue, and its eyes flickered and shone
at her; little reflected lights touched the figurines and the
gilded chairs, and she danced gravely before Hugh Crain,
who watched her, gleaming. ‘Go in and out the windows,’
she sang, and felt her hands taken as she danced. ‘Go in and
out the windows,’ and she danced out on to the verandah
and around the house. Going around and around and around
the house, she thought, and none of them can see me. She
touched a kitchen door as she passed, and six miles away
Mrs Dudley shuddered in her sleep. She came to the tower,
held so tightly in the embrace of the house, in the straining
grip of the house, and walked slowly past its grey stones,
not allowed to touch even the outside. Then she turned and
stood before the great doorway; the door was closed again,
and she put out her hand and opened it effortlessly. Thus
I enter Hill House, she told herself, and stepped inside as
though it were her own. ‘Here I am,’ she said aloud. ‘I’ve
been all around the house, in and out the windows, and I
danced——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor?’ It was Luke’s voice, and she thought, Of all
of them I would least like to have Luke catch me; don’t let
him see me, she thought beggingly, and turned and ran,
without stopping, into the library.</p>

<p class="pindent">And here I am, she thought. Here I am inside. It was not
cold at all, but deliciously, fondly warm. It was light enough
for her to see the iron stairway curving around and around
up to the tower, and the little door at the top. Under her
feet the stone floor moved caressingly, rubbing itself against
the soles of her feet, and all around the soft air touched
her, stirring her hair, drifting against her fingers, coming
in a light breath across her mouth, and she danced in circles.
No stone lions for me, she thought, no oleanders; I have
broken the spell of Hill House and somehow come inside.
I am home, she thought, and stopped in wonder at the
thought. I am home, I am home, she thought; now to
climb.</p>

<p class="pindent">Climbing the narrow iron stairway was intoxicating—going
higher and higher, around and around, looking down,
clinging to the slim iron railing, looking far far down on to
the stone floor. Climbing, looking down, she thought of the
soft green grass outside and the rolling hills and the rich
trees. Looking up, she thought of the tower of Hill House
rising triumphantly between the trees, tall over the road
which wound through Hillsdale and past a white house set
in flowers and past the magic oleanders and past the stone
lions and on, far, far away, to a little lady who was going
to pray for her. Time is ended now, she thought, all <span class="it">that</span> is
gone and left behind, and that poor little lady, praying still,
for me.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor!’</p>

<p class="pindent">For a minute she could not remember who they were (had
they been guests of hers in the house of the stone lions?
Dining at her long table in the candlelight? Had she met
them at the inn, over the tumbling stream? Had one of
them come riding down a green hill, banners flying? Had
one of them run beside her in the darkness? and then she
remembered, and they fell into place where they belonged)
and she hesitated, clinging to the railing. They were so
small, so ineffectual. They stood far below on the stone floor
and pointed at her; they called to her, and their voices were
urgent and far away.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Luke,’ she said, remembering. They could hear her,
because they were quiet when she spoke. ‘Doctor Montague,’
she said. ‘Mrs Montague. Arthur.’ She could not remember
the other, who stood silent and a little apart.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor,’ Dr Montague called, ‘turn around very carefully
and come slowly down the steps. Move very, very
slowly, Eleanor. Hold on to the railing all the time. Now
turn and come down.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What on earth is the creature doing?’ Mrs Montague
demanded. Her hair was in curlers, and her bathrobe had
a dragon on the stomach. ‘Make her come down so we can
go back to bed. Arthur, make her come down at once.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘See here,’ Arthur began, and Luke moved to the foot of
the stairway and started up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘For God’s sake be careful,’ the doctor said as Luke
moved steadily on. ‘The thing is rotted away from the wall.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It won’t hold both of you,’ Mrs Montague said positively.
‘You’ll have it down on our heads. Arthur, move over here
near the door.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eleanor,’ the doctor called, ‘can you turn around and
start down slowly?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Above her was only the little trapdoor leading out on to
the turret; she stood on the little narrow platform at the
top and pressed against the trapdoor, but it would not move.
Futilely she hammered against it with her fists, thinking
wildly, Make it open, make it open, or they’ll catch me.
Glancing over her shoulder, she could see Luke climbing
steadily, around and around. ‘Eleanor,’ he said, ‘stand still.
Don’t move,’ and he sounded frightened.</p>

<p class="pindent">I can’t get away, she thought, and looked down; she saw
one face clearly, and the name came into her mind. ‘Theodora,’
she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nell, do as they tell you. Please.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Theodora? I can’t get out; the door’s been nailed shut.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Damn right it’s been nailed shut,’ Luke said. ‘And lucky
for you, too, my girl.’ Climbing, coming very slowly, he had
almost reached the narrow platform. ‘Stay perfectly still,’
he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Stay perfectly still, Eleanor,’ the doctor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nell,’ Theodora said. ‘<span class="it">Please</span> do what they say.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why?’ Eleanor looked down and saw the dizzy fall of the
tower below her, the iron stairway clinging to the tower
walls, shaking and straining under Luke’s feet, the cold stone
floor, the distant, pale, staring faces. ‘How can I get down?’
she asked helplessly. ‘Doctor—how can I get down?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Move very slowly,’ he said. ‘Do what Luke tells you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nell,’ Theodora said, ‘don’t be frightened. It will be all
right, really.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course it will be all right,’ Luke said grimly. ‘Probably
it will only be <span class="it">my</span> neck that gets broken. Hold on, Nell; I’m
coming on to the platform. I want to get past you so you
can go down ahead of me.’ He seemed hardly out of breath,
in spite of climbing, but his hand trembled as he reached
out to take hold of the railing, and his face was wet. ‘Come
on,’ he said sharply.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor hung back. ‘The last time you told me to go ahead
you never followed,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps I will just push you over the edge,’ Luke said.
‘Let you smash down there on the floor. Now behave yourself
and move slowly; get past me and start down the stairs.
And just hope,’ he added furiously, ‘that I can resist the
temptation to give you a shove.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Meekly she came along the platform and pressed herself
against the hard stone wall while Luke moved cautiously
past her. ‘Start down,’ he said. ‘I’ll be right behind you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Precariously, the iron stairway shaking and groaning with
every step, she felt her way. She looked at her hand on
the railing, white because she was holding so tight, and at
her bare feet going one at a time, step by step, moving with
extreme care, but never looked down again to the stone floor.
Go down very slowly, she told herself over and over, not
thinking of more than the steps which seemed almost to
bend and buckle beneath her feet, go down very very very
slowly. ‘Steady,’ Luke said behind her. ‘Take it easy, Nell,
nothing to be afraid of, we’re almost there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Involuntarily, below her, the doctor and Theodora held
out their arms, as though ready to catch her if she fell, and
once when Eleanor stumbled and missed a step, the handrail
wavering as she clung to it, Theodora gasped and ran
to hold the end of the stairway. ‘It’s all right, my Nellie,’
she said over and over, ‘it’s all right, it’s all right.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Only a little farther,’ the doctor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Creeping, Eleanor slid her feet down, one step after
another, and at last, almost before she could believe it,
stepped off on to the stone floor. Behind her the stairway
rocked and clanged as Luke leaped down the last few steps
and walked steadily across the room to fall against a chair
and stop, head down and trembling still. Eleanor turned and
looked up to the infinitely high little spot where she had
been standing, at the iron stairway, warped and crooked and
swaying against the tower wall, and said in a small voice, ‘I
ran up. I ran up all the way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Montague moved purposefully forward from the
doorway where she and Arthur had been sheltering against
the probable collapse of the stairway. ‘Does anybody agree
with me,’ she asked with great delicacy, ‘in thinking that
this young woman has given us quite enough trouble tonight?
<span class="it">I</span>, for one, would like to go back to bed, and so
would Arthur.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hill House——’ the doctor began.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This childish nonsense has almost certainly destroyed any
chance of manifestations <span class="it">tonight</span>, I can tell you. I certainly
do not look to see any of our friends from beyond after
<span class="it">this</span> ridiculous performance, so if you will all excuse me—and
if you are <span class="it">sure</span> that you are finished with your posturing
and performing and waking up busy people—I will say
good night. Arthur.’ Mrs Montague swept out, dragon rampant,
quivering with indignation.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Luke was scared,’ Eleanor said, looking at the doctor and
at Theodora.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Luke was most certainly scared,’ he agreed from behind
her. ‘Luke was so scared he almost didn’t get himself down
from there. Nell, what an imbecile you are.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I would be inclined to agree with Luke.’ The doctor was
displeased, and Eleanor looked away, looked at Theodora,
and Theodora said, ‘I suppose you <span class="it">had</span> to do it, Nell?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m all right,’ Eleanor said, and could no longer look at
any of them. She looked, surprised, down at her own bare
feet, realising suddenly that they had carried her, unfeeling,
down the iron stairway. She thought, looking at her feet,
and then raised her head. ‘I came down to the library to
get a book,’ she said.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="pindent">It was humiliating, disastrous. Nothing was said at breakfast,
and Eleanor was served coffee and eggs and rolls just
like the others. She was allowed to linger over her coffee
with the rest of them, observe the sunlight outside, comment
upon the good day ahead; for a few minutes she might
have been persuaded to believe that nothing had happened.
Luke passed her the marmalade, Theodora smiled at her
over Arthur’s head, the doctor bade her good morning.
Then, after breakfast, after Mrs Dudley’s entrance at ten,
they came without comment, following one another silently,
to the little parlour, and the doctor took his position
before the fireplace. Theodora was wearing Eleanor’s red
sweater.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Luke will bring your car around,’ the doctor said gently.
In spite of what he was saying, his eyes were considerate
and friendly. ‘Theodora will go up and pack for you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor giggled. ‘She can’t. She won’t have anything to
wear.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nell——’ Theodora began, and stopped and glanced at
Mrs Montague, who shrugged her shoulders and said, ‘I
examined the room. <span class="it">Naturally</span>. I can’t imagine why none of
<span class="it">you</span> thought to do it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I was going to,’ the doctor said apologetically. ‘But I
thought——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You <span class="it">always</span> think, John, and that’s your trouble. <span class="it">Naturally</span>
I examined the room at once.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Theodora’s room?’ Luke asked. ‘I wouldn’t like to go in
there again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Montague sounded surprised. ‘I can’t think why not,’
she said. ‘There’s nothing wrong with it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I went in and looked at my clothes,’ Theodora said to
the doctor. ‘They’re perfectly fine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The room needs dusting, <span class="it">naturally</span>, but what can you
expect if you lock the door and Mrs Dudley cannot——’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor’s voice rose over his wife’s. ‘—cannot tell you
how sorry I am,’ he was saying. ‘If there is ever anything I
can do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor laughed. ‘But I can’t leave,’ she said, wondering
where to find words to explain.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You have been here quite long enough,’ the doctor said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Theodora stared at her. ‘I don’t need your clothes,’ she said
patiently. ‘Didn’t you just hear Mrs Montague? I don’t need
your clothes, and even if I <span class="it">did</span> I wouldn’t wear them now;
Nell, you’ve got to go away from here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But I can’t leave,’ Eleanor said, laughing still because
it was so perfectly impossible to explain.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Madam,’ Luke said sombrely, ‘you are no longer welcome
as my guest.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps Arthur <span class="it">had</span> better drive her back to the city.
Arthur could see that she gets there safely.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Gets where?’ Eleanor shook her head at them, feeling
her lovely heavy hair around her face. ‘Gets where?’ she
asked happily.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why,’ the doctor said, ‘home, of course,’ and Theodora
said, ‘Nell, your own little place, your own apartment, where
all your things are,’ and Eleanor laughed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I haven’t any apartment,’ she said to Theodora. ‘I made
it up. I sleep on a cot at my sister’s, in the baby’s room.
I haven’t any home, no place at all. And I can’t go back
to my sister’s because I stole her car.’ She laughed, hearing
her own words, so inadequate and so unutterably sad. ‘I
haven’t any home,’ she said again, and regarded them hopefully.
‘No home. Everything in all the world that belongs
to me is in a carton in the back of my car. That’s all I have,
some books and things I had when I was a little girl, and a
watch my mother gave me. So you see there’s no place you
can send me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I could, of course, go on and on, she wanted to tell them,
seeing always their frightened, staring faces. I could go on
and on, leaving my clothes for Theodora; I could go wandering
and homeless, errant, and I would always come back
here. It would be simpler to let me stay, more sensible, she
wanted to tell them, happier.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I want to stay here,’ she said to them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve already spoken to the sister,’ Mrs Montague said
importantly. ‘I must say, she asked first about the car. A
vulgar person; I told her she need have no fear. You were
very wrong, John, to let her steal her sister’s car and come
here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear,’ Dr Montague began, and stopped, spreading
his hands helplessly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘At any rate, she is expected. The sister was most annoyed
with me because they had planned to go off on their vacation
today, although why she should be annoyed with <span class="it">me</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’
Mrs Montague scowled at Eleanor. ‘I do think someone
ought to see her safely into their hands,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor shook his head. ‘It would be a mistake,’ he said
slowly. ‘It would be a mistake to send one of us with her.
She must be allowed to forget everything about this house
as soon as she can; we cannot prolong the association. Once
away from here, she will be herself again; can you find your
way home?’ he asked Eleanor, and Eleanor laughed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll go and get that packing done,’ Theodora said. ‘Luke,
check her car and bring it around; she’s only got one suitcase.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Walled up alive.’ Eleanor began to laugh again at their
stone faces. ‘Walled up alive,’ she said. ‘I want to stay here.’</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="pindent">They made a solid line along the steps of Hill House,
guarding the door. Beyond their heads she could see the
windows looking down, and to one side the tower waited
confidently. She might have cried if she could have thought
of any way of telling them why; instead, she smiled
brokenly up at the house, looking at her own window, at
the amused, certain face of the house, watching her quietly.
The house was waiting now, she thought, and it was waiting
for her; no one else could satisfy it. ‘The house wants me
to stay,’ she told the doctor, and he stared at her. He was
standing very stiff and with great dignity, as though he
expected her to choose him instead of the house, as though,
having brought her here, he thought that by unwinding his
directions he could send her back again. His back was
squarely turned to the house, and, looking at him honestly,
she said, ‘I’m sorry. I’m terribly sorry, really.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’ll go to Hillsdale,’ he said levelly; perhaps he was
afraid of saying too much, perhaps he thought that a kind
word, or a sympathetic one, might rebound upon himself
and bring her back. The sun was shining on the hills and
the house and the garden and the lawn and the trees and
the brook; Eleanor took a deep breath and turned, seeing
it all. ‘In Hillsdale turn on to Route Five going east; at
Ashton you will meet Route Thirty-nine, and that will take
you home. For your own safety,’ he added with a kind of
urgency, ‘for your own safety, my dear; believe me, if I
had foreseen this——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m really terribly sorry,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We can’t take chances, you know, <span class="it">any</span> chances. I am only
beginning to perceive what a terrible risk I was asking of
you all. Now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ He sighed and shook his head. ‘You’ll
remember?’ he asked. ‘To Hillsdale, and then Route
Five——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Look.’ Eleanor was quiet for a minute, wanting to tell
them all exactly how it was. ‘I wasn’t afraid,’ she said at
last. ‘I really wasn’t afraid. I’m fine now. I was—happy.’ She
looked earnestly at the doctor. ‘<span class="it">Happy</span>,’ she said. ‘I don’t
know what to say,’ she said, afraid again that she was going
to cry. ‘I don’t want to go away from here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There might be a next time,’ the doctor said sternly.
‘Can’t you understand that we <span class="it">cannot</span> take that chance?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor faltered. ‘Someone is praying for me,’ she said
foolishly. ‘A lady I met a long time ago.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor’s voice was gentle, but he tapped his foot impatiently.
‘You will forget all of this quite soon,’ he said.
‘You must forget everything about Hill House. I was so
wrong to bring you here,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How long <span class="it">have</span> we been here?’ Eleanor asked suddenly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A little over a week. Why?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s the only time anything’s ever happened to me. I
liked it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That,’ said the doctor, ‘is why you are leaving in such
a hurry.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor closed her eyes and sighed, feeling and hearing
and smelling the house; a flowering bush beyond the kitchen
was heavy with scent, and the water in the brook moved
sparkling over the stones. Far away, upstairs, perhaps in
the nursery, a little eddy of wind gathered itself and swept
along the floor, carrying dust. In the library the iron stairway
swayed, and light glittered on the marble eyes of Hugh
Crain; Theodora’s yellow shirt hung neat and unstained,
Mrs Dudley was setting the lunch-table for five. Hill House
watched, arrogant and patient. ‘I won’t go away,’ Eleanor
said up to the high windows.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You <span class="it">will</span> go away,’ the doctor said, showing his impatience
at last. ‘Right now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Eleanor laughed, and turned, holding out her hand.
‘Luke,’ she said, and he came towards her, silent. ‘Thank
you for bringing me down last night,’ she said. ‘That was
wrong of me. I know it now, and you were very brave.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I was indeed,’ Luke said. ‘It was an act of courage far
surpassing any other in <span class="it">my</span> life. And I am glad to see you
going, Nell, because I would certainly never do it again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, it seems to <span class="it">me</span>,’ Mrs Montague said, ‘if you’re going
you’d better get on with it. I’ve no quarrel with saying
good-bye, although I personally feel that you’ve all got an
exaggerated view of this place, but I <span class="it">do</span> think we’ve got
better things to do than stand here arguing when we all
know you’ve <span class="it">got</span> to go. You’ll be a time as it is, getting back
to the city, and your sister waiting to go on her vacation.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Arthur nodded. ‘Tearful farewells,’ he said. ‘Don’t hold
with them, myself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Far away, in the little parlour, the ash dropped softly in
the fireplace. ‘John,’ Mrs Montague said, ‘possibly it <span class="it">would</span>
be better if Arthur——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ the doctor said strongly. ‘Eleanor has to go back the
way she came.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And who do I thank for a lovely time?’ Eleanor asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor took her by the arm and, with Luke beside her,
led her to her car and opened the door for her. The carton
was still on the back seat, her suitcase was on the floor, her
coat and pocketbook on the seat; Luke had left the motor
running. ‘Doctor,’ Eleanor said, clutching at him, ‘Doctor.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m sorry,’ he said. ‘Good-bye.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Drive carefully,’ Luke said politely.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You can’t just <span class="it">make</span> me go,’ she said wildly. ‘You <span class="it">brought</span>
me here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And I am sending you away,’ the doctor said. ‘We won’t
forget you, Eleanor. But right now the only important thing
for <span class="it">you</span> is to forget Hill House and all of us. Good-bye.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good-bye,’ Mrs Montague said firmly from the steps, and
Arthur said, ‘Good-bye, have a good trip.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Then Eleanor, her hand on the door of the car, stopped
and turned. ‘Theo?’ she said inquiringly, and Theodora ran
down the steps to her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I thought you weren’t going to say good-bye to me,’ she
said. ‘Oh, Nellie, my Nell—be happy; please be happy.
Don’t <span class="it">really</span> forget me; some day things really <span class="it">will</span> be all
right again, and you’ll write me letters and I’ll answer and
we’ll visit each other and we’ll have fun talking over the
crazy things we did and saw and heard in Hill House—oh,
Nellie! I thought you weren’t going to say good-bye to me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good-bye,’ Eleanor said to her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nellie,’ Theodora said timidly, and put out a hand to
touch Eleanor’s cheek, ‘listen—maybe some day we can
meet here again? And have our picnic by the brook? We
never had our picnic,’ she told the doctor, and he shook his
head, looking at Eleanor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good-bye,’ Eleanor said to Mrs Montague, ‘good-bye,
Arthur. Good-bye, Doctor. I hope your book is very successful.
Luke,’ she said, ‘good-bye. And good-bye.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nell,’ Theodora said, ‘please be careful.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good-bye,’ Eleanor said, and slid into the car; it felt unfamiliar
and awkward; I am too used already to the comforts
of Hill House, she thought, and reminded herself to
wave a hand from the car window. ‘Good-bye,’ she called,
wondering if there had ever been another word for her to
say, ‘good-bye, good-bye.’ Clumsily, her hands fumbling,
she released the brake and let the car move slowly.</p>

<p class="pindent">They waved back at her dutifully, standing still, watching
her. They will watch me down the drive as far as they can
see, she thought; it is only civil for them to look at me
until I am out of sight; so now I am going. Journeys end in
lovers meeting. But I <span class="it">won’t</span> go, she thought, and laughed
aloud to herself; Hill House is not as easy as <span class="it">they</span> are; just by
telling me to go away they can’t make me leave, not if Hill
House means me to stay. ‘Go away, Eleanor,’ she chanted
aloud, ‘go away, Eleanor, we don’t want you any more, not
in <span class="it">our</span> Hill House, go away, Eleanor, you can’t stay <span class="it">here</span>;
but I can,’ she sang, ‘but I can; <span class="it">they</span> don’t make the rules
around <span class="it">here</span>. They can’t turn me out or shut me out or laugh
at me or hide from me; I won’t go, and Hill House belongs
to <span class="it">me</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">With what she perceived as quick cleverness she pressed
her foot down hard on the accelerator; they can’t run fast
enough to catch me this time, she thought, but by now they
must be beginning to realise; I wonder who notices first?
Luke, almost certainly. I can hear them calling now, she
thought, and the little footsteps running through Hill House
and the soft sound of the hills pressing closer. I am really
doing it, she thought, turning the wheel to send the car
directly at the great tree at the curve of the driveway, I am
really doing it, I am doing this all by myself, now, at last;
this is me, I am really really really doing it by myself.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the unending, crashing second before the car hurled
into the tree she thought clearly, <span class="it">Why</span> am I doing this? Why
am I doing this? Why don’t they stop me?</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Sanderson was enormously relieved to hear that Dr
Montague and his party had left Hill House; she would
have turned them out, she told the family lawyer, if Dr Montague
had shown any sign of wanting to stay. Theodora’s
friend, mollified and contrite, was delighted to see Theodora
back so soon; Luke took himself off to Paris, where his aunt
fervently hoped he would stay for a while. Dr Montague
finally retired from active scholarly pursuits after the cool,
almost contemptuous reception of his preliminary article
analysing the psychic phenomena of Hill House. Hill House
itself, not sane, stood against its hills, holding darkness
within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand
for eighty more. Within, its walls continued upright, bricks
met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut;
silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill
House, and whatever walked there, walked alone.</p>
